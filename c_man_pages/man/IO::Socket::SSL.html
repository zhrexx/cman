<h2>DESCRIPTION
<a name="DESCRIPTION"></a>
</h2>
<p style="margin-left:9%; margin-top: 1em">IO::Socket::SSL
makes using SSL/TLS much easier by wrapping the necessary
functionality into the familiar IO::Socket interface and
providing secure defaults whenever possible. This way,
existing applications can be made SSL−aware without
much effort, at least if you do blocking I/O and don't use
select or poll.</p>
<p style="margin-left:9%; margin-top: 1em">But, under the
hood, SSL is a complex beast. So there are lots of methods
to make it do what you need if the default behavior is not
adequate. Because it is easy to inadvertently introduce
critical security bugs or just hard to debug problems, I
would recommend studying the following documentation
carefully.</p>
<p style="margin-left:9%; margin-top: 1em">The
documentation consists of the following parts:</p>

<h2>Essential Information About SSL/TLS
<a name="Essential Information About SSL/TLS"></a>
</h2>
<p style="margin-left:9%; margin-top: 1em">SSL (Secure
Socket Layer) or its successor TLS (Transport Layer
Security) are protocols to facilitate end−to−end
security. These protocols are used when accessing web sites
(https), delivering or retrieving email, and in lots of
other use cases. In the following documentation we will
refer to both SSL and TLS as simply 'SSL'.</p>
<p style="margin-left:9%; margin-top: 1em">SSL enables
end−to−end security by providing two essential
functions: <br/>
Encryption</p>
<p style="margin-left:14%;">This part encrypts the data for
transit between the communicating parties, so that nobody in
between can read them. It also provides tamper resistance so
that nobody in between can manipulate the data.</p>
<p style="margin-left:9%;">Identification</p>
<p style="margin-left:14%;">This part makes sure that you
talk to the right peer. If the identification is done
incorrectly it is easy to mount
man−in−the−middle attacks, e.g. if Alice
wants to talk to Bob it would be possible for Mallory to put
itself in the middle, so that Alice talks to Mallory and
Mallory to Bob. All the data would still be encrypted, but
not end−to−end between Alice and Bob, but only
between Alice and Mallory and then between Mallory and Bob.
Thus Mallory would be able to read and modify all traffic
between Alice and Bob.</p>
<p style="margin-left:9%; margin-top: 1em">Identification
is the part which is the hardest to understand and the
easiest to get wrong.</p>
<p style="margin-left:9%; margin-top: 1em">With SSL, the
Identification is usually done with <b>certificates</b>
inside a <b>PKI</b> (Public Key Infrastructure). These
Certificates are comparable to an identity card, which
contains information about the owner of the card. The card
then is somehow <b>signed</b> by the <b>issuer</b> of the
card, the <b>CA</b> (Certificate Agency).</p>
<p style="margin-left:9%; margin-top: 1em">To verify the
identity of the peer the following must be done inside
SSL:</p>
<table border="0" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" frame="void" rules="none" width="100%">
<tr align="left" valign="top">
<td width="9%"></td>
<td width="1%">
<p>•</p></td>
<td width="4%"></td>
<td width="85%">
<p>Get the certificate from the peer. If the peer does not
present a certificate we cannot verify it.</p></td>
<td width="1%">
</td></tr>
<tr align="left" valign="top">
<td width="9%"></td>
<td width="1%">
<p>•</p></td>
<td width="4%"></td>
<td width="85%">
<p>Check if we trust the certificate, e.g. make sure it's
not a forgery.</p></td>
<td width="1%">
</td></tr>
</table>
<p style="margin-left:14%; margin-top: 1em">We believe that
a certificate is not a fake if we either know the
certificate already or if we <b>trust</b> the issuer (the
CA) and can verify the issuers signature on the certificate.
In reality there is often a hierarchy of certificate
agencies and we only directly trust the root of this
hierarchy. In this case the peer not only sends his own
certificate, but also all <b>intermediate certificates</b>.
Verification will be done by building a <b>trust path</b>
from the trusted root up to the peers certificate and
checking in each step if the we can verify the issuer's
signature.</p>
<p style="margin-left:14%; margin-top: 1em">This step often
causes problems because the client does not know the
necessary trusted root certificates. These are usually
stored in a system dependent CA store, but often the
browsers have their own CA store.</p>
<table border="0" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" frame="void" rules="none" width="100%">
<tr align="left" valign="top">
<td width="9%"></td>
<td width="1%">
<p style="margin-top: 1em">•</p></td>
<td width="4%"></td>
<td width="86%">
<p style="margin-top: 1em">Check if the certificate is
still valid. Each certificate has a lifetime and should not
be used after that time because it might be compromised or
the underlying cryptography got broken in the mean time.</p></td></tr>
<tr align="left" valign="top">
<td width="9%"></td>
<td width="1%">
<p>•</p></td>
<td width="4%"></td>
<td width="86%">
<p>Check if the subject of the certificate matches the
peer. This is like comparing the picture on the identity
card against the person representing the identity card.</p></td></tr>
</table>
<p style="margin-left:14%; margin-top: 1em">When connecting
to a server this is usually done by comparing the hostname
used for connecting against the names represented in the
certificate. A certificate might contain multiple names or
wildcards, so that it can be used for multiple hosts (e.g.
*.example.com and *.example.org).</p>
<p style="margin-left:14%; margin-top: 1em">Although nobody
sane would accept an identity card where the picture does
not match the person we see, it is a common implementation
error with SSL to omit this check or get it wrong.</p>
<table border="0" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" frame="void" rules="none" width="100%">
<tr align="left" valign="top">
<td width="9%"></td>
<td width="1%">
<p style="margin-top: 1em">•</p></td>
<td width="4%"></td>
<td width="85%">
<p style="margin-top: 1em">Check if the certificate was
revoked by the issuer. This might be the case if the
certificate was compromised somehow and now somebody else
might use it to claim the wrong identity. Such revocations
happened a lot after the heartbleed attack.</p></td>
<td width="1%">
</td></tr>
</table>
<p style="margin-left:14%; margin-top: 1em">For SSL there
are two ways to verify a revocation, CRL and OCSP. With CRLs
(Certificate Revocation List) the CA provides a list of
serial numbers for revoked certificates. The client somehow
has to download the list (which can be huge) and keep it up
to date. With OCSP (Online Certificate Status Protocol) the
client can check a single certificate directly by asking the
issuer.</p>
<p style="margin-left:14%; margin-top: 1em">Revocation is
the hardest part of the verification and none of today's
browsers get it fully correct. But, they are still better
than most other implementations which don't implement
revocation checks or leave the hard parts to the
developer.</p>
<p style="margin-left:9%; margin-top: 1em">When accessing a
web site with SSL or delivering mail in a secure way the
identity is usually only checked one way, e.g. the client
wants to make sure it talks to the right server, but the
server usually does not care which client it talks to. But,
sometimes the server wants to identify the client too and
will request a certificate from the client which the server
must verify in a similar way.</p>
<h2>Basic SSL Client
<a name="Basic SSL Client"></a>
</h2>
<p style="margin-left:9%; margin-top: 1em">A basic SSL
client is simple:</p>
<p style="margin-left:9%; margin-top: 1em">my $client =
IO::Socket::SSL−&gt;new('www.example.com:443') <br/>
or die "error=$!, ssl_error=$SSL_ERROR";</p>
<p style="margin-left:9%; margin-top: 1em">This will take
the OpenSSL default CA store as the store for the trusted
CA. This usually works on UNIX systems. If there are no
certificates in the store it will try use Mozilla::CA which
provides the default CAs of Firefox.</p>
<p style="margin-left:9%; margin-top: 1em">In the default
settings, IO::Socket::SSL will use a safer cipher set and
SSL version, do a proper hostname check against the
certificate, and use SNI (server name indication) to send
the hostname inside the SSL handshake. This is necessary to
work with servers which have different certificates behind
the same IP address. It will also check the revocation of
the certificate with OCSP, but currently only if the server
provides OCSP stapling (for deeper checks see
"ocsp_resolver" method).</p>
<p style="margin-left:9%; margin-top: 1em">Lots of options
can be used to change ciphers, SSL version, location of CA
and much more. See documentation of methods for details.</p>
<p style="margin-left:9%; margin-top: 1em">With protocols
like SMTP it is necessary to upgrade an existing socket to
SSL. This can be done like this:</p>
<p style="margin-left:9%; margin-top: 1em">my $client =
IO::Socket::INET−&gt;new('mx.example.com:25') or die
$!; <br/>
# .. read greeting from server <br/>
# .. send EHLO and read response <br/>
# .. send STARTTLS command and read response <br/>
# .. if response was successful we can upgrade the socket to
SSL now: <br/>
IO::Socket::SSL−&gt;start_SSL($client, <br/>
# explicitly set hostname we should use for SNI <br/>
SSL_hostname =&gt; 'mx.example.com' <br/>
) or die $SSL_ERROR;</p>
<p style="margin-left:9%; margin-top: 1em">A more complete
example for a simple HTTP client:</p>
<p style="margin-left:9%; margin-top: 1em">my $client =
IO::Socket::SSL−&gt;new( <br/>
# where to connect <br/>
PeerHost =&gt; "www.example.com", <br/>
PeerPort =&gt; "https", <br/>
# certificate verification − VERIFY_PEER is default
<br/>
SSL_verify_mode =&gt; SSL_VERIFY_PEER, <br/>
# location of CA store <br/>
# need only be given if default store should not be used
<br/>
SSL_ca_path =&gt; '/etc/ssl/certs', # typical CA path on
Linux <br/>
SSL_ca_file =&gt; '/etc/ssl/cert.pem', # typical CA file on
BSD <br/>
# or just use default path on system: <br/>
IO::Socket::SSL::default_ca(), # either explicitly <br/>
# or implicitly by not giving SSL_ca_* <br/>
# easy hostname verification <br/>
# It will use PeerHost as default name a verification <br/>
# scheme as default, which is safe enough for most purposes.
<br/>
SSL_verifycn_name =&gt; 'foo.bar', <br/>
SSL_verifycn_scheme =&gt; 'http', <br/>
# SNI support − defaults to PeerHost <br/>
SSL_hostname =&gt; 'foo.bar', <br/>

$!,$SSL_ERROR"; <br/>
# send and receive over SSL connection <br/>
print $client "GET / HTTP/1.0\r\n\r\n"; <br/>
print &lt;$client&gt;;</p>

<h2>Basic SSL Server
<a name="Basic SSL Server"></a>
</h2>
<p style="margin-left:9%; margin-top: 1em">A basic SSL
server looks similar to other IO::Socket servers, only that
it also contains settings for certificate and key:</p>

automatically use a secure set of ciphers and SSL version
and also supports Forward Secrecy with

<p style="margin-left:9%; margin-top: 1em">If you are doing
a forking or threading server, we recommend that you do the
SSL handshake inside the new process/thread so that the
master is free for new connections. We recommend this
because a client with improper or slow SSL handshake could

<p style="margin-left:14%; margin-top: 1em">As described in
"Essential Information About SSL/TLS", a proper
identification of the peer is essential and failing to
verify makes Man−In−The−Middle attacks
possible.</p>
<p style="margin-left:14%; margin-top: 1em">Nevertheless,
lots of scripts and even public modules or applications
disable verification, because it is probably the easiest way
to make the thing work and usually nobody notices any
security problems anyway.</p>

pattern is also to disable verification if they found no CA
store (different modules look at different
"default" places). Because IO::Socket::SSL is now
able to provide a usable CA store on most platforms (UNIX,
Mac OSX and Windows) it is better to use the defaults
provided by IO::Socket::SSL. If necessary these can be
checked with the "default_ca" method.</p>

</table>
<p style="margin-left:14%; margin-top: 1em">If you sysread
one byte on a normal socket it will result in a syscall to
read one byte. Thus, if more than one byte is available on
the socket it will be kept in the network stack of your OS
and the next select or poll call will return the socket as
readable. But, with SSL you don't deliver single bytes.
Multiple data bytes are packaged and encrypted together in
an SSL frame. Decryption can only be done on the whole
frame, so a sysread for one byte actually reads the complete
SSL frame from the socket, decrypts it and returns the first
decrypted byte. Further sysreads will return more bytes from
the same frame until all bytes are returned and the next SSL
frame will be read from the socket.</p>
<p style="margin-left:14%; margin-top: 1em">Thus, in order
to decide if you can read more data (e.g. if sysread will
block) you must check if there are still data in the current
SSL frame by calling "pending" and if there are no
data pending you might check the underlying socket with
select or poll. Another way might be if you try to sysread
at least 16kByte all the time. 16kByte is the maximum size
of an SSL frame and because sysread returns data from only a
single SSL frame you can guarantee that there are no pending
data.</p>
<p style="margin-left:14%; margin-top: 1em">Additionally,
contrary to plain sockets the data delivered on the socket
are not necessarily application payload. It might be a TLS
handshake, it might just be the beginning of a TLS record or
it might be TLS session tickets which are send after the TLS
handshake in TLS 1.3. In such situations select will return
that data are available for read since it only looks at the
plain socket. A sysread on the IO::Socket::SSL socket will
not return any data though since it is an abstraction which
only returns application data. This causes the sysread to
hang in case the socket was blocking or to return an error
with EAGAIN on non−blocking sockets. Applications
using select or similar should therefore set the socket to
non−blocking and also expect that the sysread might
temporarily fail with EAGAIN.</p>

<p style="margin-left:14%; margin-top: 1em">IO::Socket::SSL
tries to emulate the usual socket behavior as good as
possible, but full emulation can not be done. Specifically a
read on the SSL socket might also result in a write on the
TCP socket or a write on the SSL socket might result in a
read on the TCP socket. Also "accept" and
<b>close</b> on the SSL socket will result in writing and
reading data to the TCP socket too.</p>
<p style="margin-left:14%; margin-top: 1em">Especially the
hidden writes might result in a connection reset if the
underlying TCP socket is already closed by the peer. Unless
signal PIPE is explicitly handled by the application this
will usually result in the application crashing. It is thus
recommended to explicitly IGNORE signal PIPE so that the
errors get propagated as EPIPE instead of causing a crash of
the application.</p>

tries to set these values to reasonable, secure values which

some scripts or modules out there which tried to be smart
and get more secure or compatible settings. Unfortunately,
they did this years ago and never updated these values, so
they are still forced to do only 'TLSv1' (instead of also
using TLSv12 or TLSv11). Or they set 'HIGH' as the cipher
list and thought they were secure, but did not notice that
'HIGH' includes anonymous ciphers, e.g. without
identification of the peer.</p>
<p style="margin-left:14%; margin-top: 1em">So it is
recommended to leave the settings at the secure defaults

protocol with multiple implementations and each of these has
their own quirks. While most of these implementations work
together, it often gets problematic with older versions,
minimal versions in load balancers, or plain wrong
setups.</p>

these problems are hard to debug. Helpful for debugging are
a knowledge of SSL internals, wireshark and the use of the

both be set with $IO::Socket::SSL::DEBUG. The following

time one encounters an SSL peer, which just closes the
connection inside the SSL handshake. This can usually be
worked around by downgrading the SSL version, e.g. by
setting "SSL_version". Modern Browsers usually
deal with such servers by automatically downgrading the SSL
version and repeat the connection attempt until they
succeed.</p>
<p style="margin-left:14%; margin-top: 1em">Worse servers
do not close the underlying TCP connection but instead just
drop the relevant packet. This is harder to detect because
it looks like a stalled connection. But downgrading the SSL
version often works here too.</p>
<p style="margin-left:14%; margin-top: 1em">A cause of such
problems are often load balancers or security devices, which

<h2>Using Non−Blocking Sockets
<a name="Using Non−Blocking Sockets"></a>
</h2>
<p style="margin-left:9%; margin-top: 1em">If you have a
non−blocking socket, the expected behavior on read,
write, accept or connect is to set $! to EWOULDBLOCK if the
operation cannot be completed immediately. Note that
EWOULDBLOCK is the same as EAGAIN on UNIX systems, but is
different on Windows.</p>
<p style="margin-left:9%; margin-top: 1em">With SSL,
handshakes might occur at any time, even within an
established connection. In these cases it is necessary to
finish the handshake before you can read or write data. This
might result in situations where you want to read but must
first finish the write of a handshake or where you want to
write but must first finish a read. In these cases $! is set
to EAGAIN like expected, and additionally $SSL_ERROR is set
to either SSL_WANT_READ or SSL_WANT_WRITE. Thus if you get
EWOULDBLOCK on a SSL socket you must check $SSL_ERROR for
SSL_WANT_* and adapt your event mask accordingly.</p>
<p style="margin-left:9%; margin-top: 1em">Using readline
on non−blocking sockets does not make much sense and I
would advise against using it. And, while the behavior is
not documented for other IO::Socket classes, it will try to
emulate the behavior seen there, e.g. to return the received
data instead of blocking, even if the line is not complete.
If an unrecoverable error occurs it will return nothing,
even if it already received some data.</p>
<p style="margin-left:9%; margin-top: 1em">Also, I would
advise against using "accept" with a
non−blocking SSL object because it might block and
this is not what most would expect. The reason for this is
that "accept" on a non−blocking TCP socket
(e.g. IO::Socket::IP, IO::Socket::INET..) results in a new
TCP socket which does not inherit the non−blocking
behavior of the master socket. And thus, the initial SSL
handshake on the new socket inside
"IO::Socket::SSL::accept" will be done in a
blocking way. To work around this you are safer by doing a
TCP accept and later upgrade the TCP socket in a
non−blocking way with "start_SSL" and
"accept_SSL".</p>

<p style="margin-left:9%; margin-top: 1em">Additionally
there are differences to plain sockets when using select,
poll, kqueue or similar technologies to get notified if data
are available. Relying only on these calls is not sufficient
in all cases since unread data might be internally buffered
in the SSL stack. To detect such buffering <b>pending()</b>
need to be used. Alternatively the buffering can be avoided
by using <b>sysread</b> with the maximum size of an SSL
frame. See "Common Usage Errors" for details.</p>

<h3>SNI Support
<a name="SNI Support"></a>
</h3>
<p style="margin-left:9%; margin-top: 1em">Newer extensions
to SSL can distinguish between multiple hostnames on the
same IP address using Server Name Indication (SNI).</p>
<p style="margin-left:9%; margin-top: 1em">Support for SNI
on the client side was added somewhere in the OpenSSL 0.9.8
series, but with 1.0 a bug was fixed when the server could
not decide about its hostname. Therefore client side SNI is
only supported with OpenSSL 1.0 or higher in
IO::Socket::SSL. With a supported version, SNI is used
automatically on the client side, if it can determine the
hostname from "PeerAddr" or "PeerHost"
(which are synonyms in the underlying IO::Socket:: classes
and thus should never be set both or at least not to
different values). On unsupported OpenSSL versions it will
silently not use SNI. The hostname can also be given
explicitly given with "SSL_hostname", but in this
case it will throw in error, if SNI is not supported. To
check for support you might call
"IO::Socket::SSL−&gt;can_client_sni()".</p>
<p style="margin-left:9%; margin-top: 1em">On the server
side, earlier versions of OpenSSL are supported, but only
together with Net::SSLeay version &gt;= 1.50. To check for
support you might call
"IO::Socket::SSL−&gt;can_server_sni()". If
server side SNI is supported, you might specify different
certificates per host with "SSL_cert*" and
"SSL_key*", and check the requested name using
"get_servername".</p>
<h3>Talk Plain and SSL With The Same Socket
<a name="Talk Plain and SSL With The Same Socket"></a>
</h3>
<p style="margin-left:9%; margin-top: 1em">It is often
required to first exchange some plain data and then upgrade
the socket to SSL after some kind of STARTTLS command.
Protocols like FTPS even need a way to downgrade the socket
again back to plain.</p>
<p style="margin-left:9%; margin-top: 1em">The common way
to do this would be to create a normal socket and use
"start_SSL" to upgrade and stop_SSL to
downgrade:</p>
<p style="margin-left:9%; margin-top: 1em">my $sock =
IO::Socket::INET−&gt;new(...) or die $!; <br/>
... exchange plain data on $sock until starttls command ...
<br/>
IO::Socket::SSL−&gt;start_SSL($sock,%sslargs) or die
$SSL_ERROR; <br/>
... now $sock is an IO::Socket::SSL object ... <br/>
... exchange data with SSL on $sock until stoptls command
... <br/>
$sock−&gt;stop_SSL or die $SSL_ERROR; <br/>
... now $sock is again an IO::Socket::INET object ...</p>
<p style="margin-left:9%; margin-top: 1em">But, lots of
modules just derive directly from IO::Socket::INET. While
this base class can be replaced with IO::Socket::SSL, these
modules cannot easily support different base classes for SSL
and plain data and switch between these classes on a
starttls command.</p>
<p style="margin-left:9%; margin-top: 1em">To help in this
case, IO::Socket::SSL can be reduced to a plain socket on
startup, and connect_SSL/accept_SSL/start_SSL can be used to
enable SSL and "stop_SSL" to talk plain again:</p>
<p style="margin-left:9%; margin-top: 1em">my $sock =
IO::Socket::SSL−&gt;new( <br/>
PeerAddr =&gt; ... <br/>
SSL_startHandshake =&gt; 0, <br/>

) or die $!; <br/>
... exchange plain data on $sock until starttls command ...
<br/>
$sock−&gt;connect_SSL or die $SSL_ERROR; <br/>
... now $sock is an IO::Socket::SSL object ... <br/>
... exchange data with SSL on $sock until stoptls command
... <br/>
$sock−&gt;stop_SSL or die $SSL_ERROR; <br/>
... $sock is still an IO::Socket::SSL object ... <br/>
... but data exchanged again in plain ...</p>
<h2>Integration Into Own Modules
<a name="Integration Into Own Modules"></a>
</h2>
<p style="margin-left:9%; margin-top: 1em">IO::Socket::SSL
behaves similarly to other IO::Socket modules and thus could
be integrated in the same way, but you have to take special
care when using non−blocking I/O (like for handling
timeouts) or using select or poll. Please study the
documentation on how to deal with these differences.</p>
<p style="margin-left:9%; margin-top: 1em">Also, it is
recommended to not set or touch most of the
"SSL_*" options, so that they keep their secure
defaults. It is also recommended to let the user override
these SSL specific settings without the need of global
settings or hacks like "set_args_filter_hack".</p>
<p style="margin-left:9%; margin-top: 1em">The notable
exception is "SSL_verifycn_scheme". This should be
set to the hostname verification scheme required by the
module or protocol.</p>
<h2>Description Of Methods
<a name="Description Of Methods"></a>
</h2>
<p style="margin-left:9%; margin-top: 1em">IO::Socket::SSL
inherits from another IO::Socket module. The choice of the
super class depends on the installed modules:</p>
<table border="0" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" frame="void" rules="none" width="100%">
<tr align="left" valign="top">

<td width="9%"></td>
<td width="1%">
<p>•</p></td>

<tr align="left" valign="top">
<td width="9%"></td>

<p>Otherwise it will fall back to IO::Socket::INET, which
is a perl core module. With IO::Socket::INET you only get
IPv4 support.</p></td>
<td width="1%">
</td></tr>
</table>
<p style="margin-left:9%; margin-top: 1em">Please be aware
that with the IPv6 capable super classes, it will look first
for the IPv6 address of a given hostname. If the resolver
provides an IPv6 address, but the host cannot be reached by
IPv6, there will be no automatic fallback to IPv4. To avoid
these problems you can enforce IPv4 for a specific socket by
using the "Domain" or "Family" option
with the value AF_INET as described in IO::Socket::IP.
Alternatively you can enforce IPv4 globally by loading
IO::Socket::SSL with the option 'inet4', in which case it
will use the IPv4 only class IO::Socket::INET as the super
class.</p>
<p style="margin-left:9%; margin-top: 1em">IO::Socket::SSL
will provide all of the methods of its super class, but
sometimes it will override them to match the behavior
expected from SSL or to provide additional arguments.</p>
<p style="margin-left:9%; margin-top: 1em">The new or
changed methods are described below, but please also read
the section about SSL specific error handling. <br/>
Error Handling</p>
<p style="margin-left:14%;">If an SSL specific error
occurs, the global variable $SSL_ERROR will be set. If the
error occurred on an existing SSL socket, the method
"errstr" will give access to the latest socket
specific error. Both $SSL_ERROR and the "errstr"
method give a dualvar similar to $!, e.g. providing an error
number in numeric context or an error description in string
context.</p>
<p style="margin-left:9%;"><b>new(...)</b></p>
<p style="margin-left:14%;">Creates a new IO::Socket::SSL
object. You may use all the friendly options that came
bundled with the super class (e.g. IO::Socket::IP,
IO::Socket::INET, ...) plus (optionally) the ones described
below. If you don't specify any SSL related options it will
do its best in using secure defaults, e.g. choosing good
ciphers, enabling proper verification, etc. <br/>
SSL_server</p>
<p style="margin-left:17%;">Set this option to a true value
if the socket should be used as a server. If this is not
explicitly set it is assumed if the "Listen"
parameter is given when creating the socket.</p>
<p style="margin-left:14%;">SSL_hostname</p>
<p style="margin-left:17%;">This can be given to specify
the hostname used for SNI, which is needed if you have
multiple SSL hostnames on the same IP address. If not given
it will try to determine the hostname from
"PeerAddr", which will fail if only an IP was
given or if this argument is used within
"start_SSL".</p>
<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">If you want to
disable SNI, set this argument to ''.</p>
<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">Currently only
supported for the client side and will be ignored for the
server side.</p>
<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">See section
"SNI Support" for details of SNI the support.</p>
<p style="margin-left:14%;">SSL_startHandshake</p>
<p style="margin-left:17%;">If this option is set to false
(defaults to true) it will not start the SSL handshake yet.
This has to be done later with "accept_SSL" or
"connect_SSL". Before the handshake is started
read/write/etc. can be used to exchange plain data.</p>
<p style="margin-left:14%;">SSL_keepSocketOnError</p>
<p style="margin-left:17%;">If this option is set to true
(defaults to false) it will not close the underlying TCP
socket on errors. In most cases there is no real use for
this behavior since both sides of the TCP connection will
probably have a different idea of the current state of the
connection.</p>
<p style="margin-left:14%;">SSL_ca | SSL_ca_file |
SSL_ca_path</p>
<p style="margin-left:17%;">Usually you want to verify that
the peer certificate has been signed by a trusted
certificate authority. In this case you should use this
option to specify the file ("SSL_ca_file") or
directory ("SSL_ca_path") containing the
certificate(s) of the trusted certificate authorities.</p>
<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">"SSL_ca_path"
can also be an array or a string containing multiple path,
where the path are separated by the platform specific
separator. This separator is ";" on DOS, Windows,
Netware, "," on VMS and ":" for all the
other systems. If multiple path are given at least one of
these must be accessible.</p>
<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">You can also
give a list of X509* certificate handles (like you get from
Net::SSLeay or IO::Socket::SSL::Utils::PEM_xxx2cert) with
"SSL_ca". These will be added to the CA store
before path and file and thus take precedence. If neither
SSL_ca, nor SSL_ca_file or SSL_ca_path are set it will use
default_ca() to determine the user−set or system
defaults. If you really don't want to set a CA set
SSL_ca_file or SSL_ca_path to "\undef" or SSL_ca
to an empty list. (unfortunately '' is used by some modules
using IO::Socket::SSL when CA is not explicitly given).</p>
<p style="margin-left:14%;">SSL_client_ca |
SSL_client_ca_file</p>
<p style="margin-left:17%;">If verify_mode is VERIFY_PEER
on the server side these options can be used to set the list
of acceptable CAs for the client. This way the client can
select they required certificate from a list of
certificates. The value for these options is similar to
"SSL_ca" and "SSL_ca_file".</p>
<p style="margin-left:14%;">SSL_fingerprint</p>
<p style="margin-left:17%;">Sometimes you have a
self−signed certificate or a certificate issued by an
unknown CA and you really want to accept it, but don't want
to disable verification at all. In this case you can specify
the fingerprint of the certificate as
'algo$hex_fingerprint'. "algo" is a fingerprint
algorithm supported by OpenSSL, e.g. 'sha1','sha256'... and
"hex_fingerprint" is the hexadecimal
representation of the binary fingerprint. Any colons inside
the hex string will be ignored.</p>
<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">If you want to
use the fingerprint of the pubkey inside the certificate
instead of the certificate use the syntax
'algo$pub$hex_fingerprint' instead. To get the fingerprint
of an established connection you can use
"get_fingerprint".</p>
<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">It is also
possible to skip "algo$", i.e. only specify the
fingerprint. In this case the likely algorithms will be
automatically detected based on the length of the digest
string.</p>
<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">Examples:</p>
<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">sha1$pub$f0f0c49b8a04a2dd2110e10f7806c97d87d0b26f
# pubkey SHA−1 <br/>
sha1$f0f0c49b8a04a2dd2110e10f7806c97d87d0b26f # certificate
SHA−1 <br/>
f0f0c49b8a04a2dd2110e10f7806c97d87d0b26f # certificate
SHA−1</p>
<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">You can specify
a list of fingerprints in case you have several acceptable
certificates. If a fingerprint matches the topmost (i.e.
leaf) certificate no additional validations can make the
verification fail.</p>
<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">Note that the
default behavior of SSL_fingerprint is to be an alternative
to the normal validation. A mismatching fingerprint does not
override a successful validation of the certificate, but a
matching fingerprint can override an otherwise failed
validation. To enforce a fingerprint see
"SSL_force_fingerprint".</p>
<p style="margin-left:14%;">SSL_force_fingerprint</p>
<p style="margin-left:17%;">This option should be set to
true if a failed fingerprint validation should override an
otherwise successful certificate validation.</p>
<p style="margin-left:14%;">SSL_cert_file | SSL_cert |
SSL_key_file | SSL_key</p>
<p style="margin-left:17%;">If you create a server you
usually need to specify a server certificate which should be
verified by the client. Same is true for client
certificates, which should be verified by the server. The
certificate can be given as a file with SSL_cert_file or as
an internal representation of an X509* object (like you get
from Net::SSLeay or IO::Socket::SSL::Utils::PEM_xxx2cert)
with SSL_cert. If given as a file it will automatically
detect the format. Supported file formats are PEM, DER and
PKCS#12, where PEM and PKCS#12 can contain the certificate
and the chain to use, while DER can only contain a single
certificate.</p>
<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">If given as a
list of X509* please note, that the all the chain
certificates (e.g. all except the first) will be
"consumed" by openssl and will be freed if the SSL
context gets destroyed − so you should never free them
yourself. But the servers certificate (e.g. the first) will
not be consumed by openssl and thus must be freed by the
application.</p>
<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">For each
certificate a key is need, which can either be given as a
file with SSL_key_file or as an internal representation of
an EVP_PKEY* object with SSL_key (like you get from
Net::SSLeay or IO::Socket::SSL::Utils::PEM_xxx2key). If a
key was already given within the PKCS#12 file specified by
SSL_cert_file it will ignore any SSL_key or SSL_key_file. If
no SSL_key or SSL_key_file was given it will try to use the
PEM file given with SSL_cert_file again, maybe it contains
the key too.</p>
<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">If your SSL
server should be able to use different certificates on the
same IP address, depending on the name given by SNI, you can
use a hash reference instead of a file with
"&lt;hostname =" cert_file&gt;&gt;.</p>
<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">If your SSL
server should be able to use both RSA and ECDSA certificates
for the same domain/IP a similar hash reference like with
SNI is given. The domain names used to specify the
additional certificates should be
"hostname%whatever", i.e. "hostname%ecc"
or similar. This needs at least OpenSSL 1.0.2. To let the
server pick the certificate based on the clients cipher
preference "SSL_honor_cipher_order" should be set
to false.</p>
<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">In case certs
and keys are needed but not given it might fall back to
builtin defaults, see "Defaults for Cert, Key and
CA".</p>
<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">Examples:</p>
<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">SSL_cert_file
=&gt; 'mycert.pem', <br/>
SSL_key_file =&gt; 'mykey.pem', <br/>
SSL_cert_file =&gt; { <br/>
"foo.example.org" =&gt; 'foo−cert.pem', <br/>
"foo.example.org%ecc" =&gt;
'foo−ecc−cert.pem', <br/>
"bar.example.org" =&gt; 'bar−cert.pem', <br/>
# used when nothing matches or client does not support SNI
<br/>
'' =&gt; 'default−cert.pem', <br/>
'%ecc' =&gt; 'default−ecc−cert.pem', <br/>
}, <br/>
SSL_key_file =&gt; { <br/>
"foo.example.org" =&gt; 'foo−key.pem', <br/>
"foo.example.org%ecc" =&gt;
'foo−ecc−key.pem', <br/>
"bar.example.org" =&gt; 'bar−key.pem', <br/>
# used when nothing matches or client does not support SNI
<br/>
'' =&gt; 'default−key.pem', <br/>
'%ecc' =&gt; 'default−ecc−key.pem', <br/>
}</p>
<p style="margin-left:14%;">SSL_passwd_cb</p>
<p style="margin-left:17%;">If your private key is
encrypted, you might not want the default password prompt
from Net::SSLeay. This option takes a reference to a
subroutine that should return the password required to
decrypt your private key.</p>
<p style="margin-left:14%;">SSL_use_cert</p>
<p style="margin-left:17%;">If this is true, it forces
IO::Socket::SSL to use a certificate and key, even if you
are setting up an SSL client. If this is set to 0 (the
default), then you will only need a certificate and key if
you are setting up a server.</p>
<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">SSL_use_cert
will implicitly be set if SSL_server is set. For convenience
it is also set if it was not given but a cert was given for
use (SSL_cert_file or similar).</p>
<p style="margin-left:14%;">SSL_version</p>
<p style="margin-left:17%;">Sets the version of the SSL
protocol used to transmit data. 'SSLv23' uses a handshake
compatible with SSL2.0, SSL3.0 and TLS1.x, while 'SSLv2',
'SSLv3', 'TLSv1', 'TLSv1_1', 'TLSv1_2', or 'TLSv1_3'
restrict handshake and protocol to the specified version.
All values are case−insensitive. Instead of 'TLSv1_1',
'TLSv1_2', and 'TLSv1_3' one can also use 'TLSv11',
'TLSv12', and 'TLSv13'. Which protocol versions are actually
supported depend on the versions of OpenSSL and Net::SSLeay
installed, but modern protocols like TLS 1.3 are supported
by these for many years now. The default SSL_version is
defined by the underlying cryptographic library.</p>
<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">Independent
from the handshake format you can limit to set of accepted
SSL versions by adding !version separated by ':'.</p>
<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">For example,
'SSLv23:!TLSv1:!TLSv1_1:!SSLv3:!SSLv2' means that the
handshake format is compatible to SSL2.0 and higher, but
that the successful handshake is limited to TLS1.2 and
higher, that is no SSL2.0, SSL3.0, TLS 1.0 or TLS 1.1
because these versions have serious security issues and
should not be used anymore.</p>
<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">You can also
use !TLSv1_1 and !TLSv1_2 to disable TLS versions 1.1 and
1.2 while still allowing TLS version 1.0. Setting the
version instead to 'TLSv1' might break interaction with very
old or broken clients, which expect a SSL2.0 compatible
handshake. On the other side some broken clients just close
the connection when they receive a TLS version 1.1 request.
In this case setting the version to
'SSLv23:!SSLv2:!SSLv3:!TLSv1_1:!TLSv1_2' might help.</p>
<p style="margin-left:14%;">SSL_cipher_list</p>
<p style="margin-left:17%;">If this option is set the
cipher list for the connection will be set to the given
value, e.g. something like 'ALL:!LOW:!EXP:!aNULL'. This will
only affect ciphers for TLS 1.2 and lower. See the OpenSSL
documentation
(&lt;https://www.openssl.org/docs/manmaster/man1/openssl−ciphers.html#CIPHER−STRINGS&gt;)
for more details.</p>
<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">Unless you fail
to contact your peer because of no shared ciphers it is
recommended to leave this option at the default setting,
which honors the system−wide PROFILE=SYSTEM cipher
list.</p>
<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">In case
different cipher lists are needed for different SNI hosts a
hash can be given with the host as key and the cipher suite
as value, similar to <b>SSL_cert*</b>.</p>
<p style="margin-left:14%;">SSL_ciphersuites</p>
<p style="margin-left:17%;">If this option is set the TLS
1.3 ciphersuites for the connection will be set to the given
value. This is similar to SSL_cipher_list, but only for TLS
1.3 ciphers. See argument "−ciphersuites" in
the OpenSSL documentation
(&lt;https://www.openssl.org/docs/manmaster/man1/openssl−ciphers.html&gt;)
for details.</p>
<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">Unless you fail
to contact your peer because of no shared ciphers it is
recommended to leave this option at the default setting,
which uses the system default.</p>
<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">In case
different cipher lists are needed for different SNI hosts a
hash can be given with the host as key and the cipher suite
as value, similar to <b>SSL_cert*</b>.</p>
<p style="margin-left:14%;">SSL_honor_cipher_order</p>
<p style="margin-left:17%;">If this option is true the
cipher order the server specified is used instead of the
order proposed by the client. This option defaults to true
to make use of our secure cipher list setting.</p>
<p style="margin-left:14%;">SSL_dh_file</p>
<p style="margin-left:17%;">To create a server which
provides forward secrecy you need to either give the DH
parameters or (better, because faster) the ECDH curve. This
setting cares about DH parameters.</p>
<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">To support
non−elliptic Diffie−Hellman key exchange a
suitable file needs to be given here or the SSL_dh should be
used with an appropriate value. See dhparam command in
openssl for more information.</p>
<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">If neither
"SSL_dh_file" nor "SSL_dh" are set a
builtin DH parameter with a length of 2048 bit is used to
offer DH key exchange by default. If you don't want this
(e.g. disable DH key exchange) explicitly set this or the
"SSL_dh" parameter to undef.</p>
<p style="margin-left:14%;">SSL_dh</p>
<p style="margin-left:17%;">Like SSL_dh_file, but instead
of giving a file you use a preloaded or generated DH*.</p>
<p style="margin-left:14%;">SSL_ecdh_curve</p>
<p style="margin-left:17%;">To create a server which
provides forward secrecy you need to either give the DH
parameters or (better, because faster) the ECDH curve. This
setting cares about the ECDH curve(s).</p>
<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">To support
Elliptic Curve Diffie−Hellmann key exchange the OID or
NID of at least one suitable curve needs to be provided
here.</p>
<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">With OpenSSL
1.1.0+ this parameter defaults to "auto", which
means that it lets OpenSSL pick the best settings. If
support for CTX_set_ecdh_auto is implemented in Net::SSLeay
(needs at least version 1.86) it will use this to implement
the same default. Otherwise it will default to
"prime256v1" (builtin of OpenSSL) in order to
offer ECDH key exchange by default.</p>
<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">If setting
groups or curves is supported by Net::SSLeay (needs at least
version 1.86) then multiple curves can be given here in the
order of the preference, i.e.
"P−521:P−384:P−256". When used
at the client side this will include the supported curves as
extension in the TLS handshake.</p>
<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">If you don't
want to have ECDH key exchange this could be set to undef or
set "SSL_ciphers" to exclude all of these
ciphers.</p>
<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">You can check
if ECDH support is available by calling
"IO::Socket::SSL−&gt;can_ecdh".</p>
<p style="margin-left:14%;">SSL_verify_mode</p>
<p style="margin-left:17%;">This option sets the
verification mode for the peer certificate. You may combine
SSL_VERIFY_PEER (verify_peer),
SSL_VERIFY_FAIL_IF_NO_PEER_CERT (fail verification if no
peer certificate exists; ignored for clients),
SSL_VERIFY_CLIENT_ONCE (verify client once; ignored for
clients). See OpenSSL man page for SSL_CTX_set_verify for
more information.</p>
<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">The default is
SSL_VERIFY_NONE for server (e.g. no check for client
certificate) and SSL_VERIFY_PEER for client (check server
certificate).</p>
<p style="margin-left:14%;">SSL_verify_callback</p>
<p style="margin-left:17%;">If you want to verify
certificates yourself, you can pass a sub reference along
with this parameter to do so. When the callback is called,
it will be passed: <br/>
1. a true/false value that indicates what OpenSSL thinks of
the <br/>
certificate, <br/>
2. a C−style memory address of the certificate store,
<br/>
3. a string containing the certificate's issuer attributes
and <br/>
owner attributes, and <br/>
4. a string containing any errors encountered (0 if no
errors). <br/>
5. a C−style memory address of the peer's own
certificate <br/>
(convertible to PEM form with <b><br/>
Net::SSLeay::PEM_get_string_X509()</b>). <br/>
6. The depth of the certificate in the chain. Depth 0 is the
leaf <br/>
certificate.</p>
<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">The function
should return 1 or 0, depending on whether it thinks the
certificate is valid or invalid. The default is to let
OpenSSL do all of the busy work.</p>
<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">The callback
will be called for each element in the certificate
chain.</p>
<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">See the OpenSSL
documentation for SSL_CTX_set_verify for more
information.</p>
<p style="margin-left:14%;">SSL_verifycn_scheme</p>
<p style="margin-left:17%;">The scheme is used to correctly
verify the identity inside the certificate by using the
hostname of the peer. See the information about the
verification schemes in <b>verify_hostname</b>.</p>
<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">If you don't
specify a scheme it will use 'default', but only complain
loudly if the name verification fails instead of letting the
whole certificate verification fail. THIS WILL CHANGE, e.g.
it will let the certificate verification fail in the future
if the hostname does not match the certificate !!!! To
override the name used in verification use
<b>SSL_verifycn_name</b>.</p>
<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">The scheme
'default' is a superset of the usual schemes, which will
accept the hostname in common name and subjectAltName and
allow wildcards everywhere. While using this scheme is way
more secure than no name verification at all you better
should use the scheme specific to your application protocol,
e.g. 'http', 'ftp'...</p>
<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">If you are
really sure, that you don't want to verify the identity
using the hostname you can use 'none' as a scheme. In this
case you'd better have alternative forms of verification,
like a certificate fingerprint or do a manual verification
later by calling <b>verify_hostname</b> yourself.</p>
<p style="margin-left:14%;">SSL_verifycn_publicsuffix</p>
<p style="margin-left:17%;">This option is used to specify
the behavior when checking wildcards certificates for public
suffixes, e.g. no wildcard certificates for *.com or *.co.uk
should be accepted, while *.example.com or *.example.co.uk
is ok.</p>
<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">If not
specified it will simply use the builtin default of
IO::Socket::SSL::PublicSuffix, you can create another object
with from_string or from_file of this module.</p>
<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">To disable
verification of public suffix set this option to ''.</p>
<p style="margin-left:14%;">SSL_verifycn_name</p>
<p style="margin-left:17%;">Set the name which is used in
verification of hostname. If SSL_verifycn_scheme is set and
no SSL_verifycn_name is given it will try to use
SSL_hostname or PeerHost and PeerAddr settings and fail if
no name can be determined. If SSL_verifycn_scheme is not set
it will use a default scheme and warn if it cannot determine
a hostname, but it will not fail.</p>
<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">Using PeerHost
or PeerAddr works only if you create the connection directly
with "IO::Socket::SSL−&gt;new", if an
IO::Socket::INET object is upgraded with <b>start_SSL</b>
the name has to be given in <b>SSL_verifycn_name</b> or
<b>SSL_hostname</b>.</p>
<p style="margin-left:14%;">SSL_check_crl</p>
<p style="margin-left:17%;">If you want to verify that the
peer certificate has not been revoked by the signing
authority, set this value to true. OpenSSL will search for
the CRL in your SSL_ca_path, or use the file specified by
SSL_crl_file. See the Net::SSLeay documentation for more
details. Note that this functionality appears to be broken
with OpenSSL &lt; v0.9.7b, so its use with lower versions
will result in an error.</p>
<p style="margin-left:14%;">SSL_crl_file</p>
<p style="margin-left:17%;">If you want to specify the CRL
file to be used, set this value to the pathname to be used.
This must be used in addition to setting SSL_check_crl.</p>
<p style="margin-left:14%;">SSL_ocsp_mode</p>
<p style="margin-left:17%;">Defines how certificate
revocation is done using OCSP (Online Status Revocation
Protocol). The default is to send a request for OCSP
stapling to the server and if the server sends an OCSP
response back the result will be used.</p>
<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">Any other OCSP
checking needs to be done manually with
"ocsp_resolver".</p>
<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">The following
flags can be combined with "|": <br/>
SSL_OCSP_NO_STAPLE</p>
<p style="margin-left:27%;">Don't ask for OCSP stapling.
This is the default if SSL_verify_mode is VERIFY_NONE.</p>
<p style="margin-left:17%;">SSL_OCSP_TRY_STAPLE</p>
<p style="margin-left:27%;">Try OCSP stapling, but don't
complain if it gets no stapled response back. This is the
default if SSL_verify_mode is VERIFY_PEER (the default).</p>
<p style="margin-left:17%;">SSL_OCSP_MUST_STAPLE</p>
<p style="margin-left:27%;">Consider it a hard error, if
the server does not send a stapled OCSP response back. Most
servers currently send no stapled OCSP response back.</p>
<p style="margin-left:17%;">SSL_OCSP_FAIL_HARD</p>
<p style="margin-left:27%;">Fail hard on response errors,
default is to fail soft like the browsers do. Soft errors
mean, that the OCSP response is not usable, e.g. no
response, error response, no valid signature etc.
Certificate revocations inside a verified response are
considered hard errors in any case.</p>
<p style="margin-left:27%; margin-top: 1em">Soft errors
inside a stapled response are never considered hard, e.g. it
is expected that in this case an OCSP request will be send
to the responsible OCSP responder.</p>
<p style="margin-left:17%;">SSL_OCSP_FULL_CHAIN</p>
<p style="margin-left:27%;">This will set up the
"ocsp_resolver" so that all certificates from the
peer chain will be checked, otherwise only the leaf
certificate will be checked against revocation.</p>
<p style="margin-left:14%;">SSL_ocsp_staple_callback</p>
<p style="margin-left:17%;">If this callback is defined, it
will be called with the SSL object and the OCSP response
handle obtained from the peer, e.g.
"&lt;$cb−"($ssl,$resp)&gt;&gt;. If the peer
did not provide a stapled OCSP response the function will be
called with "$resp=undef". Because the OCSP
response handle is no longer valid after leaving this
function it should not by copied or freed. If access to the
response is necessary after leaving this function it can be
serialized with
"Net::SSLeay::i2d_OCSP_RESPONSE".</p>
<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">If no such
callback is provided, it will use the default one, which
verifies the response and uses it to check if the
certificate(s) of the connection got revoked.</p>
<p style="margin-left:14%;">SSL_ocsp_cache</p>
<p style="margin-left:17%;">With this option a cache can be
given for caching OCSP responses, which could be shared
between different SSL contexts. If not given a cache
specific to the SSL context only will be used.</p>
<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">You can either
create a new cache with
"IO::Socket::SSL::OCSP_Cache−&gt;new([size])"
or implement your own cache, which needs to have methods
"put($key,\%entry)" and get($key) (returning
"\%entry") where entry is the hash representation
of the OCSP response with fields like
"nextUpdate". The default implementation of the
cache will consider responses valid as long as
"nextUpdate" is less then the current time.</p>
<p style="margin-left:14%;">SSL_psk</p>
<p style="margin-left:17%;">PSK to use instead of
certificate. Requires the peer to use the same PSK.</p>
<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">On the client
side the identity and psk need to be provided as
array−ref with "&lt;[identity,psk]"&gt;.
Alternatively only the psk might be provided, in which case
"io_socket_ssl" is used as identity. On the server
side a single psk might be given which will then be use no
matter which identity hint was given by the client.
Alternatively a hash−ref can be provided with identity
as key and psk as value to serve clients with different psk
based on the identity hint. The special identity '' is used
to set a default psk.</p>
<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">To use PSK make
sure to have the relevant ciphers enabled. With TLS 1.3 this
is implicit, but with TLS 1.2 and lower explicitly add PSK
to "SSL_cipher_list" since it is not enabled by
default.</p>
<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">Note that the
given psk is expected to be binary and not hexadecimal as
some other tools do. To convert hex to binary use
"pack("H*",hexstring)". Also note that
the error messages one gets if either identity or psk don't
match the configuration in the peer can be useless
("handshake failure") or misleading ("bad
mac").</p>
<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">PSK support
needs respective API functionality in Net::SSLeay, which was
only fully included in 1.94.
"IO::Socket::SSL−&gt;can_psk()" returns
undef if functionality is not available and a hash−ref
with details otherwise: key "client" in the hash
signals support for using PSK in a SSL client (available
since Net::SSLeay 1.82) while key server for support of PSK
in SSL server (since Net::SSLeay 1.94).</p>
<p style="margin-left:14%;">SSL_reuse_ctx</p>
<p style="margin-left:17%;">If you have already set the
above options for a previous instance of IO::Socket::SSL,
then you can reuse the SSL context of that instance by
passing it as the value for the SSL_reuse_ctx parameter. You
may also create a new instance of the
IO::Socket::SSL::SSL_Context class, using any context
options that you desire without specifying connection
options, and pass that here instead.</p>
<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">If you use this
option, all other context−related options that you
pass in the same call to <b>new()</b> will be ignored unless
the context supplied was invalid. Note that, contrary to
versions of IO::Socket::SSL below v0.90, a global SSL
context will not be implicitly used unless you use the
<b>set_default_context()</b> function.</p>
<p style="margin-left:14%;">SSL_create_ctx_callback</p>
<p style="margin-left:17%;">With this callback you can make
individual settings to the context after it got created and
the default setup was done. The callback will be called with
the CTX object from Net::SSLeay as the single argument.</p>
<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">Example for
limiting the server session cache size:</p>
<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">SSL_create_ctx_callback
=&gt; sub { <br/>
my $ctx = shift; <br/>
Net::SSLeay::CTX_sess_set_cache_size($ctx,128); <br/>
}</p>
<p style="margin-left:14%;">SSL_session_cache_size</p>
<p style="margin-left:17%;">If you make repeated
connections to the same host/port and the SSL renegotiation
time is an issue, you can turn on client−side session
caching with this option by specifying a positive cache
size. For successive connections, pass the SSL_reuse_ctx
option to the <b>new()</b> calls (or use
<b>set_default_context()</b>) to make use of the cached
sessions. The session cache size refers to the number of
unique host/port pairs that can be stored at one time; the
oldest sessions in the cache will be removed if new ones are
added.</p>
<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">This option
does not effect the session cache a server has for it's
clients, e.g. it does not affect SSL objects with SSL_server
set.</p>
<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">Note that
session caching with TLS 1.3 needs at least Net::SSLeay
1.86.</p>
<p style="margin-left:14%;">SSL_session_cache</p>
<p style="margin-left:17%;">Specifies session cache object
which should be used instead of creating a new. Overrules
SSL_session_cache_size. This option is useful if you want to
reuse the cache, but not the rest of the context.</p>
<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">A session cache
object can be created using
"IO::Socket::SSL::Session_Cache−&gt;new(
cachesize )".</p>
<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">Use
<b>set_default_session_cache()</b> to set a global cache
object.</p>
<p style="margin-left:14%;">SSL_session_key</p>
<p style="margin-left:17%;">Specifies a key to use for
lookups and inserts into client−side session cache.
Per default ip:port of destination will be used, but
sometimes you want to share the same session over multiple
ports on the same server (like with FTPS).</p>
<p style="margin-left:14%;">SSL_session_id_context</p>
<p style="margin-left:17%;">This gives an id for the
servers session cache. It's necessary if you want clients to
connect with a client certificate. If not given but
SSL_verify_mode specifies the need for client certificate a
context unique id will be picked.</p>
<p style="margin-left:14%;">SSL_error_trap</p>
<p style="margin-left:17%;">When using the <b>accept()</b>
or <b>connect()</b> methods, it may be the case that the
actual socket connection works but the SSL negotiation
fails, as in the case of an HTTP client connecting to an
HTTPS server. Passing a subroutine ref attached to this
parameter allows you to gain control of the orphaned socket
instead of having it be closed forcibly. The subroutine, if
called, will be passed two parameters: a reference to the
socket on which the SSL negotiation failed and the full text
of the error message.</p>
<p style="margin-left:14%;">SSL_npn_protocols</p>
<p style="margin-left:17%;">If used on the server side it
specifies list of protocols advertised by SSL server as an
array ref, e.g. ['spdy/2','http1.1']. On the client side it
specifies the protocols offered by the client for NPN as an
array ref. See also method
"next_proto_negotiated".</p>
<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">Next Protocol
Negotiation (NPN) is available with Net::SSLeay 1.46+ and
openssl−1.0.1+. NPN is unavailable in TLSv1.3
protocol. To check support you might call
"IO::Socket::SSL−&gt;can_npn()". If you use
this option with an unsupported Net::SSLeay/OpenSSL it will
throw an error.</p>
<p style="margin-left:14%;">SSL_alpn_protocols</p>
<p style="margin-left:17%;">If used on the server side it
specifies list of protocols supported by the SSL server as
an array ref, e.g. ['http/2.0', 'spdy/3.1','http/1.1']. On
the client side it specifies the protocols advertised by the
client for ALPN as an array ref. See also method
"alpn_selected".</p>
<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">Application−Layer
Protocol Negotiation (ALPN) is available with Net::SSLeay
1.56+ and openssl−1.0.2+. More details about the
extension are in RFC7301. To check support you might call
"IO::Socket::SSL−&gt;can_alpn()". If you use
this option with an unsupported Net::SSLeay/OpenSSL it will
throw an error.</p>
<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">Note that some
client implementations may encounter problems if both NPN
and ALPN are specified. Since ALPN is intended as a
replacement for NPN, try providing ALPN protocols then fall
back to NPN if that fails.</p>
<p style="margin-left:14%;">SSL_ticket_keycb =&gt;
[$sub,$data] | $sub</p>
<p style="margin-left:17%;">This is a callback used for
stateless session reuse (Session Tickets, RFC 5077).</p>
<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">This callback
will be called as
"$sub−&gt;($data,[$key_name])" where $data
is the argument given to SSL_ticket_keycb (or undef) and
$key_name depends on the mode: <br/>
encrypt ticket</p>
<p style="margin-left:27%;">If a ticket needs to be
encrypted the callback will be called without $key_name. In
this case it should return
"($current_key,$current_key_name") where
$current_key is the current key (32 byte random data) and
$current_key_name the name associated with this key (exactly
16 byte). This $current_key_name will be incorporated into
the ticket.</p>
<p style="margin-left:17%;">decrypt ticket</p>
<p style="margin-left:27%;">If a ticket needs to be
decrypted the callback will be called with $key_name as
found in the ticket. It should return
"($key,$current_key_name") where $key is the key
associated with the given $key_name and $current_key_name
the name associated with the currently active key. If
$current_key_name is different from the given $key_name the
callback will be called again to re−encrypt the ticket
with the currently active key.</p>
<p style="margin-left:27%; margin-top: 1em">If no key can
be found which matches the given $key_name then this
function should return nothing (empty list).</p>
<p style="margin-left:27%; margin-top: 1em">This mechanism
should be used to limit the life time for each key
encrypting the ticket. Compromise of a ticket encryption key
might lead to decryption of SSL sessions which used session
tickets protected by this key.</p>
<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">Example:</p>
<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">Net::SSLeay::RAND_bytes(my
$oldkey,32); <br/>
Net::SSLeay::RAND_bytes(my $newkey,32); <br/>
my $oldkey_name = pack("a16",'oldsecret'); <br/>
my $newkey_name = pack("a16",'newsecret'); <br/>

return; <br/>
},\@keys ]; <br/>
my $srv = IO::Socket::SSL−&gt;new(...,
SSL_ticket_keycb =&gt; $keycb);</p>
<p style="margin-left:14%;">SSL_mode_release_buffers
1|0</p>
<p style="margin-left:17%;">This enables or disables the
SSL_MODE_RELEASE_BUFFERS option on the SSL object. With this
option the read buffer will be released after each SSL_read
but will need to be reallocated for each new SSL_read. If
memory usage is a concern this might save lots of memory in
the mean time though, about 34k per idle SSL connection
according to the documentation in
<b>SSL_CTX_set_mode</b>(3ssl).</p>
<p style="margin-left:9%;"><b>accept</b></p>
<p style="margin-left:14%;">This behaves similar to the
accept function of the underlying socket class, but
additionally does the initial SSL handshake. But because the
underlying socket class does return a blocking file handle
even when accept is called on a non−blocking socket,
the SSL handshake on the new file object will be done in a
blocking way. Please see the section about
non−blocking I/O for details. If you don't like this
behavior you should do accept on the TCP socket and then
upgrade it with "start_SSL" later.</p>
<p style="margin-left:9%;"><b>connect(...)</b></p>
<p style="margin-left:14%;">This behaves similar to the
connect function but also does an SSL handshake. Because you
cannot give SSL specific arguments to this function, you
should better either use "new" to create a connect
SSL socket or "start_SSL" to upgrade an
established TCP socket to SSL.</p>
<p style="margin-left:9%;"><b>close(...)</b></p>
<p style="margin-left:14%;">Contrary to a close for a
simple INET socket a close in SSL also mandates a proper
shutdown of the SSL part. This is done by sending a close
notify message by both peers.</p>
<p style="margin-left:14%; margin-top: 1em">A naive
implementation would thus wait until it receives the close
notify message from the peer − which conflicts with
the commonly expected semantic that a close will not block.
The default behavior is thus to only send a close notify but
not wait for the close notify of the peer. If this is
required "SSL_fast_shutdown" need to be explicitly
set to false.</p>
<p style="margin-left:14%; margin-top: 1em">There are also
cases where a SSL shutdown should not be done at all. This
is true for example when forking to let a child deal with
the socket and closing the socket in the parent process. A
naive explicit "close" or an implicit close when
destroying the socket in the parent would send a close
notify to the peer which would make the SSL socket in the
client process unusable. In this case an explicit
"close" with "SSL_no_shutdown" set to
true should be done in the parent process.</p>
<p style="margin-left:14%; margin-top: 1em">For more
details and other arguments see "stop_SSL" which
gets called from "close" to shutdown the SSL state
of the socket.</p>
<p style="margin-left:9%;"><b>sysread( BUF, LEN, [ OFFSET ]
)</b></p>
<p style="margin-left:14%;">This function behaves from the
outside the same as <b>sysread</b> in other IO::Socket
objects, e.g. it returns at most LEN bytes of data. But in
reality it reads not only LEN bytes from the underlying
socket, but at a single SSL frame. It then returns up to LEN
bytes it decrypted from this SSL frame. If the frame
contained more data than requested it will return only LEN
data, buffer the rest and return it on further read calls.
This means, that it might be possible to read data, even if
the underlying socket is not readable, so using poll or
select might not be sufficient.</p>
<p style="margin-left:14%; margin-top: 1em">sysread will
only return data from a single SSL frame, e.g. either the
pending data from the already buffered frame or it will read
a frame from the underlying socket and return the decrypted
data. It will not return data spanning several SSL frames in
a single call.</p>
<p style="margin-left:14%; margin-top: 1em">Also, calls to
sysread might fail, because it must first finish an SSL
handshake.</p>
<p style="margin-left:14%; margin-top: 1em">To understand
these behaviors is essential, if you write applications
which use event loops and/or non−blocking sockets.
Please read the specific sections in this documentation.</p>
<p style="margin-left:9%;"><b>syswrite( BUF, [ LEN, [
OFFSET ]] )</b></p>
<p style="margin-left:14%;">This functions behaves from the
outside the same as <b>syswrite</b> in other IO::Socket
objects, e.g. it will write at most LEN bytes to the socket,
but there is no guarantee, that all LEN bytes are written.
It will return the number of bytes written. Because it
basically just calls SSL_write from OpenSSL syswrite will
write at most a single SSL frame. This means, that no more
than 16.384 bytes, which is the maximum size of an SSL
frame, will be written at once.</p>
<p style="margin-left:14%; margin-top: 1em">For
non−blocking sockets SSL specific behavior applies.
Please read the specific section in this documentation.</p>
<p style="margin-left:9%;"><b>peek( BUF, LEN, [ OFFSET
])</b></p>
<p style="margin-left:14%;">This function has exactly the
same syntax as <b>sysread</b>, and performs nearly the same
task but will not advance the read position so that
successive calls to <b>peek()</b> with the same arguments
will return the same results. This function requires OpenSSL
0.9.6a or later to work.</p>
<p style="margin-left:9%;"><b>pending()</b></p>
<p style="margin-left:14%;">This function gives you the
number of bytes available without reading from the
underlying socket object. This function is essential if you
work with event loops, please see the section about polling
SSL sockets.</p>
<p style="margin-left:9%;"><b>get_fingerprint([algo,certificate,pubkey])</b></p>
<p style="margin-left:14%;">This methods returns the
fingerprint of the given certificate in the form
"algo$digest_hex", where "algo" is the
used algorithm, default 'sha256'. If no certificate is given
the peer certificate of the connection is used. If
"pubkey" is true it will not return the
fingerprint of the certificate but instead the fingerprint
of the pubkey inside the certificate as
"algo$pub$digest_hex".</p>
<p style="margin-left:9%;"><b>get_fingerprint_bin([algo,certificate,pubkey])</b></p>
<p style="margin-left:14%;">This methods returns the binary
fingerprint of the given certificate by using the algorithm
"algo", default 'sha256'. If no certificate is
given the peer certificate of the connection is used. If
"pubkey" is true it will not return the
fingerprint of the certificate but instead the fingerprint
of the pubkey inside the certificate.</p>
<p style="margin-left:9%;"><b>get_cipher()</b></p>
<p style="margin-left:14%;">Returns the string form of the
cipher that the IO::Socket::SSL object is using.</p>
<p style="margin-left:9%;"><b>get_sslversion()</b></p>
<p style="margin-left:14%;">Returns the string
representation of the SSL version of an established
connection.</p>
<p style="margin-left:9%;"><b>get_sslversion_int()</b></p>
<p style="margin-left:14%;">Returns the integer
representation of the SSL version of an established
connection.</p>
<p style="margin-left:9%;"><b>get_session_reused()</b></p>
<p style="margin-left:14%;">This returns true if the
session got reused and false otherwise. Note that with a
reused session no certificates are send within the handshake
and no ciphers are offered and thus functions which rely on
this might not work.</p>
<p style="margin-left:9%;"><b>dump_peer_certificate()</b></p>
<p style="margin-left:14%;">Returns a parsable string with
select fields from the peer SSL certificate. This method
directly returns the result of the
<b>dump_peer_certificate()</b> method of Net::SSLeay.</p>
<p style="margin-left:9%;"><b>peer_certificate($field;[$refresh])</b></p>
<p style="margin-left:14%;">If a peer certificate exists,
this function can retrieve values from it. If no field is
given the internal representation of certificate from
Net::SSLeay is returned. If refresh is true it will not used
a cached version, but check again in case the certificate of
the connection has changed due to renegotiation.</p>
<p style="margin-left:14%; margin-top: 1em">The following
fields can be queried: <br/>
authority (alias issuer)</p>
<p style="margin-left:24%;">The certificate authority which
signed the certificate.</p>
<p style="margin-left:14%;">owner (alias subject)</p>
<p style="margin-left:24%;">The owner of the
certificate.</p>
<p style="margin-left:14%;">commonName (alias cn) −
only for Net::SSLeay version &gt;=1.30</p>
<p style="margin-left:24%;">The common name, usually the
server name for SSL certificates.</p>
<p style="margin-left:14%;">subjectAltNames − only
for Net::SSLeay version &gt;=1.33</p>
<p style="margin-left:24%;">Alternative names for the
subject, usually different names for the same server, like
example.org, example.com, *.example.com.</p>
<p style="margin-left:24%; margin-top: 1em">It returns a
list of (typ,value) with typ GEN_DNS, GEN_IPADD etc (these
constants are exported from IO::Socket::SSL). See
Net::SSLeay::X509_get_subjectAltNames.</p>
<p style="margin-left:9%;"><b>sock_certificate($field)</b></p>
<p style="margin-left:14%;">This is similar to
"peer_certificate" but will return the sites own
certificate. The same arguments for <b>$field</b> can be
used. If no <b>$field</b> is given the certificate handle
from the underlying OpenSSL will be returned. This handle
will only be valid as long as the SSL connection exists and
if used afterwards it might result in strange crashes of the
application.</p>
<p style="margin-left:9%;"><b>peer_certificates</b></p>
<p style="margin-left:14%;">This returns all the
certificates send by the peer, e.g. first the peers own
certificate and then the rest of the chain. You might use
<b>CERT_asHash</b> from IO::Socket::SSL::Utils to inspect
each of the certificates.</p>
<p style="margin-left:14%; margin-top: 1em">This function
depends on a version of Net::SSLeay &gt;= 1.58 .</p>
<p style="margin-left:9%;"><b>get_servername</b></p>
<p style="margin-left:14%;">This gives the name requested
by the client if Server Name Indication (SNI) was used.</p>
<p style="margin-left:9%;"><b>verify_hostname($hostname,$scheme,$publicsuffix)</b></p>
<p style="margin-left:14%;">This verifies the given
hostname against the peer certificate using the given
scheme. Hostname is usually what you specify within the
PeerAddr. See the "SSL_verifycn_publicsuffix"
parameter for an explanation of suffix checking and for the
possible values.</p>
<p style="margin-left:14%; margin-top: 1em">Verification of
hostname against a certificate is different between various
applications and RFCs. Some scheme allow wildcards for
hostnames, some only in subjectAltNames, and even their
different wildcard schemes are possible. RFC 6125 provides a
good overview.</p>
<p style="margin-left:14%; margin-top: 1em">To ease the
verification the following schemes are predefined (both
protocol name and rfcXXXX name can be used): <br/>
rfc2818, xmpp (rfc3920), ftp (rfc4217)</p>
<p style="margin-left:24%;">Extended wildcards in
subjectAltNames and common name are possible, e.g.
*.example.org or even www*.example.org. The common name will
be only checked if no DNS names are given in

<p style="margin-left:14%;">http (alias www)</p>
<p style="margin-left:24%;">While name checking is defined
in rfc2818 the current browsers usually accept also an IP
address (w/o wildcards) within the common name as long as no
subjectAltNames are defined. Thus this is rfc2818 extended
with this feature.</p>

<p style="margin-left:24%;">Simple wildcards in
subjectAltNames are possible, e.g. *.example.org matches
www.example.org but not lala.www.example.org. If nothing
from subjectAltNames match it checks against the common
name, where wildcards are also allowed to match the full
leftmost label.</p>
<p style="margin-left:14%;">ldap (rfc4513)</p>

<p style="margin-left:14%; margin-top: 1em">The scheme can
be given either by specifying the name for one of the above
predefined schemes, or by using a hash which can have the
following keys and values: <br/>
check_cn: 0|'always'|'when_only'</p>
<p style="margin-left:24%;">Determines if the common name
gets checked. If 'always' it will always be checked (like in
ldap), if 'when_only' it will only be checked if no names
are given in subjectAltNames (like in http), for any other
values the common name will not be checked.</p>
<p style="margin-left:14%;">wildcards_in_alt:
0|'full_label'|'anywhere'</p>
<p style="margin-left:24%;">Determines if and where
wildcards in subjectAltNames are possible. If 'full_label'
only cases like *.example.org will be possible (like in
ldap), for 'anywhere' www*.example.org is possible too (like
http), dangerous things like but www.*.org or even '*' will
not be allowed. For compatibility with older versions
'leftmost' can be given instead of 'full_label'.</p>
<p style="margin-left:14%;">wildcards_in_cn:
0|'full_label'|'anywhere'</p>
<p style="margin-left:24%;">Similar to wildcards_in_alt,
but checks the common name. There is no predefined scheme
which allows wildcards in common names.</p>
<p style="margin-left:14%;">ip_in_cn: 0|1|4|6</p>
<p style="margin-left:24%;">Determines if an IP address is
allowed in the common name (no wildcards are allowed). If
set to 4 or 6 it only allows IPv4 or IPv6 addresses, any
other true value allows both.</p>
<p style="margin-left:14%;">callback: \&amp;coderef</p>
<p style="margin-left:24%;">If you give a subroutine for
verification it will be called with the arguments
($hostname,$commonName,@subjectAltNames), where hostname is
the name given for verification, commonName is the result
from peer_certificate('cn') and subjectAltNames is the
result from peer_certificate('subjectAltNames').</p>
<p style="margin-left:24%; margin-top: 1em">All other
arguments for the verification scheme will be ignored in
this case.</p>
<p style="margin-left:9%;"><b>next_proto_negotiated()</b></p>
<p style="margin-left:14%;">This method returns the name of
negotiated protocol − e.g. 'http/1.1'. It works for
both client and server side of SSL connection.</p>
<p style="margin-left:14%; margin-top: 1em">NPN support is
available with Net::SSLeay 1.46+ and openssl−1.0.1+.
To check support you might call
"IO::Socket::SSL−&gt;can_npn()".</p>
<p style="margin-left:9%;"><b>alpn_selected()</b></p>
<p style="margin-left:14%;">Returns the protocol negotiated
via ALPN as a string, e.g. 'http/1.1', 'http/2.0' or
'spdy/3.1'.</p>
<p style="margin-left:14%; margin-top: 1em">ALPN support is
available with Net::SSLeay 1.56+ and openssl−1.0.2+.
To check support, use
"IO::Socket::SSL−&gt;can_alpn()".</p>
<p style="margin-left:9%;"><b>errstr()</b></p>
<p style="margin-left:14%;">Returns the last error (in
string form) that occurred. If you do not have a real object
to perform this method on, call
<b>IO::Socket::SSL::errstr()</b> instead.</p>
<p style="margin-left:14%; margin-top: 1em">For read and
write errors on non−blocking sockets, this method may
include the string "SSL wants a read first!" or
"SSL wants a write first!" meaning that the other
side is expecting to read from or write to the socket and
wants to be satisfied before you get to do anything. But
with version 0.98 you are better comparing the global
exported variable $SSL_ERROR against the exported symbols
SSL_WANT_READ and SSL_WANT_WRITE.</p>
<p style="margin-left:9%;"><b>opened()</b></p>
<p style="margin-left:14%;">This returns false if the
socket could not be opened, 1 if the socket could be opened
and the SSL handshake was successful done and −1 if
the underlying IO::Handle is open, but the SSL handshake
failed.</p>
<p style="margin-left:9%;"><b>IO::Socket::SSL−&gt;start_SSL($socket,
... )</b></p>
<p style="margin-left:14%;">This will convert a glob
reference or a socket that you provide to an IO::Socket::SSL
object. You may also pass parameters to specify context or
connection options as with a call to <b>new()</b>. If you
are using this function on an <b>accept()</b>ed socket, you
must set the parameter "SSL_server" to 1, i.e.
IO::Socket::SSL−&gt;start_SSL($socket, SSL_server
=&gt; 1). If you have a class that inherits from
IO::Socket::SSL and you want the $socket to be blessed into
your own class instead, use
MyClass−&gt;start_SSL($socket) to achieve the desired
effect.</p>
<p style="margin-left:14%; margin-top: 1em">Note that if
<b>start_SSL()</b> fails in SSL negotiation, $socket will
remain blessed in its original class. For non−blocking
sockets you better just upgrade the socket to
IO::Socket::SSL and call accept_SSL or connect_SSL and the
upgraded object. To just upgrade the socket set
<b>SSL_startHandshake</b> explicitly to 0. If you call
start_SSL w/o this parameter it will revert to blocking
behavior for accept_SSL and connect_SSL.</p>
<p style="margin-left:14%; margin-top: 1em">If given the
parameter "Timeout" it will stop if after the
timeout no SSL connection was established. This parameter is
only used for blocking sockets, if it is not given the
default Timeout from the underlying IO::Socket will be
used.</p>
<p style="margin-left:9%;"><b>stop_SSL(...)</b></p>
<p style="margin-left:14%;">This is the opposite of
<b>start_SSL()</b>, <b>connect_SSL()</b> and
<b>accept_SSL()</b>, e.g. it will shutdown the SSL
connection and return to the class before
<b>start_SSL()</b>. It gets the same arguments as
<b>close()</b>, in fact <b>close()</b> calls
<b>stop_SSL()</b> (but without downgrading the class).</p>
<p style="margin-left:14%; margin-top: 1em">Will return
true if it succeeded and undef if failed. This might be the
case for non−blocking sockets. In this case $! is set
to EWOULDBLOCK and the ssl error to SSL_WANT_READ or
SSL_WANT_WRITE. In this case the call should be retried
again with the same arguments once the socket is ready.</p>
<p style="margin-left:14%; margin-top: 1em">For calling
from "stop_SSL" "SSL_fast_shutdown"
default to false, e.g. it waits for the close_notify of the
peer. This is necessary in case you want to downgrade the
socket and continue to use it as a plain socket.</p>
<p style="margin-left:14%; margin-top: 1em">After stop_SSL
the socket can again be used to exchange plain data.</p>
<p style="margin-left:9%;"><b>connect_SSL</b>,
<b>accept_SSL</b></p>
<p style="margin-left:14%;">These functions should be used
to do the relevant handshake, if the socket got created with
"new" or upgraded with "start_SSL" and
"SSL_startHandshake" was set to false. They will
return undef until the handshake succeeded or an error got
thrown. As long as the function returns undef and $! is set
to EWOULDBLOCK one could retry the call after the socket got
readable (SSL_WANT_READ) or writeable (SSL_WANT_WRITE).</p>
<p style="margin-left:9%;"><b>set_msg_callback</b></p>
<p style="margin-left:14%;">This will add/remove a user
defined callback for each message, internally using openssl
SSL_set_msg_callback API. To make sure that the callback is
active before the handshake starts, combine it with
"SSL_startHandshake =&gt; 0" in the preceding
setup of the SSL object. To remove callback explicitly call
it with an empty callback function.</p>
<p style="margin-left:14%; margin-top: 1em">Example:</p>
<p style="margin-left:14%; margin-top: 1em">$sock =
IO::Socket::SSL−&gt;new( .... , SSL_startHandshake
=&gt; 0); <br/>
# set callback <br/>
$sock−&gt;set_msg_callback(\&amp;cb, $cbarg1,
$cbarg2); <br/>
$sock−&gt;connect_SSL(); <br/>
sub cb { <br/>
my ($sock, <br/>
# see SSL_set_msg_callback for the following args <br/>
$direction, $ssl_ver, $content_type, $buf, $len, $ssl, <br/>
$cbarg1, $cbarg2) <br/>
= @_; <br/>
... <br/>
if (no_longer_need_cb) { <br/>
# disable callback <br/>
$sock−&gt;set_msg_callback(undef); <br/>
} <br/>
}</p>
<p style="margin-left:9%;"><b>ocsp_resolver</b></p>
<p style="margin-left:14%;">This will create an OCSP
resolver object, which can be used to create OCSP requests
for the certificates of the SSL connection. Which
certificates are verified depends on the setting of
"SSL_ocsp_mode": by default only the leaf
certificate will be checked, but with SSL_OCSP_FULL_CHAIN
all chain certificates will be checked.</p>
<p style="margin-left:14%; margin-top: 1em">Because to
create an OCSP request the certificate and its issuer
certificate need to be known it is not possible to check
certificates when the trust chain is incomplete or if the
certificate is self−signed.</p>
<p style="margin-left:14%; margin-top: 1em">The OCSP
resolver gets created by calling
"$ssl−&gt;ocsp_resolver" and provides the
following methods: <br/>
hard_error</p>
<p style="margin-left:24%;">This returns the hard error
when checking the OCSP response. Hard errors are certificate
revocations. With the "SSL_ocsp_mode" of
SSL_OCSP_FAIL_HARD any soft error (e.g. failures to get
signed information about the certificates) will be
considered a hard error too.</p>
<p style="margin-left:24%; margin-top: 1em">The OCSP
resolving will stop on the first hard error.</p>
<p style="margin-left:24%; margin-top: 1em">The method will
return undef as long as no hard errors occurred and still
requests to be resolved. If all requests got resolved and no
hard errors occurred the method will return ''.</p>
<p style="margin-left:14%;">soft_error</p>
<p style="margin-left:24%;">This returns the soft error(s)
which occurred when asking the OCSP responders.</p>
<p style="margin-left:14%;">requests</p>
<p style="margin-left:24%;">This will return a hash
consisting of "(url,request)"−tuples, e.g.
which contain the OCSP request string and the URL where it
should be sent too. The usual way to send such a request is
as HTTP POST request with a content−type of
"application/ocsp−request" or as a GET
request with the base64 and url−encoded request is
added to the path of the URL.</p>
<p style="margin-left:24%; margin-top: 1em">After you've
handled all these requests and added the response with
"add_response" you should better call this method
again to make sure, that no more requests are outstanding.
IO::Socket::SSL will combine multiple OCSP requests for the
same server inside a single request, but some server don't
give a response to all these requests, so that one has to
ask again with the remaining requests.</p>
<p style="margin-left:14%;">add_response($uri,$response)</p>
<p style="margin-left:24%;">This method takes the HTTP body
of the response which got received when sending the OCSP
request to $uri. If no response was received or an error
occurred one should either retry or consider $response as
empty which will trigger a soft error.</p>
<p style="margin-left:24%; margin-top: 1em">The method
returns the current value of "hard_error", e.g. a
defined value when no more requests need to be done.</p>
<p style="margin-left:14%;">resolve_blocking(%args)</p>
<p style="margin-left:24%;">This combines
"requests" and "add_response" which
HTTP::Tiny to do all necessary requests in a blocking way.
%args will be given to HTTP::Tiny so that you can put proxy
settings etc here. HTTP::Tiny will be called with
"verify_SSL" of false, because the OCSP responses
have their own signatures so no extra SSL verification is
needed.</p>
<p style="margin-left:24%; margin-top: 1em">If you don't
want to use blocking requests you need to roll your own user
agent with "requests" and
"add_response".</p>
<p style="margin-left:9%;"><b>IO::Socket::SSL−&gt;new_from_fd($fd,
[mode], %sslargs)</b></p>
<p style="margin-left:14%;">This will convert a socket
identified via a file descriptor into an SSL socket. Note
that the argument list does not include a "MODE"
argument; if you supply one, it will be thoughtfully ignored
(for compatibility with IO::Socket::INET). Instead, a mode
of '+&lt;' is assumed, and the file descriptor passed must
be able to handle such I/O because the initial SSL handshake
requires bidirectional communication.</p>
<p style="margin-left:14%; margin-top: 1em">Internally the
given $fd will be upgraded to a socket object using the
"new_from_fd" method of the super class
(IO::Socket::INET or similar) and then "start_SSL"
will be called using the given %sslargs. If $fd is already
an IO::Socket object you should better call
"start_SSL" directly.</p>
<p style="margin-left:9%;"><b>IO::Socket::SSL::default_ca([
path|dir| SSL_ca_file =</b> ..., SSL_ca_path <br/>
=&gt; ... ])&gt;</p>
<p style="margin-left:14%;">Determines or sets the default
CA path. If existing path or dir or a hash is given it will
set the default CA path to this value and never try to
detect it automatically. If "undef" is given it
will forget any stored defaults and continue with detection
of system defaults. If no arguments are given it will start
detection of system defaults, unless it has already stored
user−set or previously detected values.</p>
<p style="margin-left:14%; margin-top: 1em">The detection
of system defaults works similar to OpenSSL, e.g. it will
check the directory specified in environment variable
SSL_CERT_DIR or the path OPENSSLDIR/certs (SSLCERTS: on VMS)
and the file specified in environment variable SSL_CERT_FILE
or the path OPENSSLDIR/cert.pem (SSLCERTS:cert.pem on VMS).
Contrary to OpenSSL it will check if the SSL_ca_path
contains PEM files with the hash as file name and if the
SSL_ca_file looks like PEM. If no usable system default can
be found it will try to load and use Mozilla::CA and if not
available give up detection. The result of the detection
will be saved to speed up future calls.</p>
<p style="margin-left:14%; margin-top: 1em">The function
returns the saved default CA as hash with SSL_ca_file and
SSL_ca_path.</p>
<p style="margin-left:9%;"><b>IO::Socket::SSL::set_default_context(...)</b></p>
<p style="margin-left:14%;">You may use this to make
IO::Socket::SSL automatically re−use a given context
(unless specifically overridden in a call to <b>new()</b>).
It accepts one argument, which should be either an
IO::Socket::SSL object or an IO::Socket::SSL::SSL_Context
object. See the SSL_reuse_ctx option of <b>new()</b> for
more details. Note that this sets the default context
globally, so use with caution (esp. in mod_perl
scripts).</p>
<p style="margin-left:9%;"><b>IO::Socket::SSL::set_default_session_cache(...)</b></p>
<p style="margin-left:14%;">You may use this to make
IO::Socket::SSL automatically re−use a given session
cache (unless specifically overridden in a call to
<b>new()</b>). It accepts one argument, which should be an
IO::Socket::SSL::Session_Cache object or similar (e.g.
something which implements get_session, add_session and
del_session like IO::Socket::SSL::Session_Cache does). See
the SSL_session_cache option of <b>new()</b> for more
details. Note that this sets the default cache globally, so
use with caution.</p>
<p style="margin-left:9%;"><b>IO::Socket::SSL::set_defaults(%args)</b></p>
<p style="margin-left:14%;">With this function one can set
defaults for all SSL_* parameter used for creation of the
context, like the SSL_verify* parameter. Any SSL_* parameter
can be given or the following short versions: <br/>
mode − SSL_verify_mode <br/>
callback − SSL_verify_callback <br/>
scheme − SSL_verifycn_scheme <br/>
name − SSL_verifycn_name</p>
<p style="margin-left:9%;"><b>IO::Socket::SSL::set_client_defaults(%args)</b></p>
<p style="margin-left:14%;">Similar to
"set_defaults", but only sets the defaults for
client mode.</p>
<p style="margin-left:9%;"><b>IO::Socket::SSL::set_server_defaults(%args)</b></p>
<p style="margin-left:14%;">Similar to
"set_defaults", but only sets the defaults for
server mode.</p>
<p style="margin-left:9%;"><b>IO::Socket::SSL::set_args_filter_hack(\&amp;code|'use_defaults')</b></p>
<p style="margin-left:14%;">Sometimes one has to use code
which uses unwanted or invalid arguments for SSL, typically
disabling SSL verification or setting wrong ciphers or SSL
versions. With this hack it is possible to override these
settings and restore sanity. Example:</p>
<p style="margin-left:14%; margin-top: 1em">IO::Socket::SSL::set_args_filter_hack(
sub { <br/>
my ($is_server,$args) = @_; <br/>
if ( ! $is_server ) { <br/>
# client settings − enable verification with default
CA <br/>
# and fallback hostname verification etc <br/>
delete @{$args}{qw( <br/>
SSL_verify_mode <br/>
SSL_ca_file <br/>
SSL_ca_path <br/>
SSL_verifycn_scheme <br/>
SSL_version <br/>
)}; <br/>
# and add some fingerprints for known certs which are signed
by <br/>
# unknown CAs or are self−signed <br/>
$args−&gt;{SSL_fingerprint} = ... <br/>
} <br/>
});</p>
<p style="margin-left:14%; margin-top: 1em">With the short
setting set_args_filter_hack('use_defaults') it will prefer
the default settings in all cases. These default settings
can be modified with "set_defaults",
"set_client_defaults" and
"set_server_defaults".</p>
<p style="margin-left:9%; margin-top: 1em">The following
methods are unsupported (not to mention futile!) and
IO::Socket::SSL will emit a large <b>CROAK()</b> if you are
silly enough to use them: <br/>
truncate <br/>
stat <br/>
ungetc <br/>
setbuf <br/>
setvbuf <br/>
fdopen <br/>
send/recv</p>
<p style="margin-left:14%;">Note that <b>send()</b> and
<b>recv()</b> cannot be reliably trapped by a tied
filehandle (such as that used by IO::Socket::SSL) and so may
send unencrypted data over the socket. Object−oriented
calls to these functions will fail, telling you to use the
print/printf/syswrite and read/sysread families instead.</p>
<h2>ACCESS TO INTERNALS
<a name="ACCESS TO INTERNALS"></a>
</h2>
<p style="margin-left:9%; margin-top: 1em">"IO::Socket::SSL"
uses internally "Net::SSLeay" which provides a
lower level API to OpenSSL and provides functions which work
directly with OpenSSL SSL and CTX handles. Sometimes it
might be necessary to get direct access to these handles
from "IO::Socket::SSL" in order to apply
functionality available only with
"Net::SSLeay".</p>
<p style="margin-left:9%; margin-top: 1em">For this
"_get_ssl_object" can be used on the
"IO::Socket::SSL" object to get access to the
OpenSSL SSL handle and "_get_ctx_object" can be
used on "IO::Socket::SSL" and
"IO::Socket::SSL_Context" objects to access the
OpenSSL CTX handle. Use very carefully since OpenSSL
memory/reference management must be done manually with
"Net::SSLeay".</p>
<h2>DEPRECATIONS

</h2>
<p style="margin-left:9%; margin-top: 1em">If you use
IO::Socket::SSL together with threads you should load it
(e.g. use or require) inside the main thread before creating
any other threads which use it. This way it is much faster
because it will be initialized only once. Also there are
reports that it might crash the other way.</p>
<p style="margin-left:9%; margin-top: 1em">Creating an

another thread will not work.</p>

See BUGS file for more information and how to work around
the problem.</p>
<p style="margin-left:9%; margin-top: 1em">If you have a
server and it looks like you have a memory leak you might
check the size of your session cache. Default for
