− static variables without namespace pollution</p>

<h2>DESCRIPTION
<a name="DESCRIPTION"></a>
</h2>
<p style="margin-left:9%; margin-top: 1em">This module
implements lexical scoping of static variables and
subroutines. Although it can be used directly, it is mainly
intended to be infrastructure for modules that manage
namespaces.</p>
<p style="margin-left:9%; margin-top: 1em">This module
influences the meaning of single−part variable names
that appear directly in code, such as "$foo".
Normally, in the absence of any particular declaration, or
under the effect of an "our" declaration, this
would refer to the scalar variable of that name located in
the current package. A "Lexical::Var" declaration
can change this to refer to any particular scalar, bypassing
the package system entirely. A variable name that includes
an explicit package part, such as "$main::foo",
always refers to the variable in the specified package, and
is unaffected by this module. A symbolic reference through a
string value, such as ""${'foo'}"", also
looks in the package system, and so is unaffected by this
module.</p>
<p style="margin-left:9%; margin-top: 1em">The types of
name that can be influenced are scalar ("$foo"),
array ("@foo"), hash ("%foo"),
subroutine ("&amp;foo"), and glob
("*foo"). A definition for any of these names also
affects code that logically refers to the same entity, even
when the name is spelled without its usual sigil. For
example, any definition of "@foo" affects element
references such as "$foo[0]". Barewords in
filehandle context actually refer to the glob variable.
Bareword references to subroutines, such as
"foo(123)", only work on Perl 5.11.2 and later; on
earlier Perls you must use the "&amp;" sigil, as
in "&amp;foo(123)".</p>
<p style="margin-left:9%; margin-top: 1em">Where a scalar
name is defined to refer to a constant (read−only)
scalar, references to the constant through the lexical
namespace can participate in compile−time constant
folding. This can avoid the need to check configuration
values (such as whether debugging is enabled) at
runtime.</p>
<p style="margin-left:9%; margin-top: 1em">A name
definition supplied by this module takes effect from the end
of the definition statement up to the end of the immediately
enclosing block, except where it is shadowed within a nested
block. This is the same lexical scoping that the
"my", "our", and "state"
keywords supply. Definitions from Lexical::Var and from
"my"/"our"/"state" can shadow
each other (except that Lexical::Var can't shadow a
"my"/"our"/"state" subroutine
prior to Perl 5.19.1). These lexical definitions propagate
into string "eval"s, on Perl versions that support
it (5.9.3 and later).</p>
<p style="margin-left:9%; margin-top: 1em">This module only
manages variables of static duration (the kind of duration
that "our" and "state" variables have).
To get a fresh variable for each invocation of a function,
use "my".</p>
<h2>PACKAGE METHODS
<a name="PACKAGE METHODS"></a>
</h2>
<p style="margin-left:9%; margin-top: 1em">These methods
are meant to be invoked on the "Lexical::Var"
package. <br/>
Lexical::Var−&gt;import(NAME =&gt; REF, ...)</p>
<p style="margin-left:14%;">Sets up lexical variable
declarations, in the lexical environment that is currently
compiling. Each <i>NAME</i> must be a variable name (e.g.,
"<b>$foo</b>") including sigil, and each
<i>REF</i> must be a reference to a variable/value of the
appropriate type. The name is lexically associated with the
referenced variable/value.</p>
<p style="margin-left:14%; margin-top: 1em">Scalar::Construct
can be helpful in generating appropriate <i>REF</i>s,
especially to create constants. There are Perl core bugs to
beware of around compile−time constants; see
"BUGS".</p>
<p style="margin-left:9%;">Lexical::Var−&gt;unimport(NAME
[=&gt; REF], ...)</p>
<p style="margin-left:14%;">Sets up negative lexical
variable declarations, in the lexical environment that is
currently compiling. Each <i>NAME</i> must be a variable
name (e.g., "<b>$foo</b>") including sigil. If the
name is given on its own, it is lexically dissociated from
any value. Within the resulting scope, the variable name
will not be recognised. If a <i>REF</i> (which must be a
reference to a value of the appropriate type) is specified
with a name, the name will be dissociated if and only if it
is currently associated with that value.</p>
<h2>BUGS
<a name="BUGS"></a>
</h2>
<p style="margin-left:9%; margin-top: 1em">Subroutine
invocations without the "&amp;" sigil cannot be
correctly processed on Perl versions earlier than 5.11.2.
This is because the parser needs to look up the subroutine
early, in order to let any prototype affect parsing, and it
looks up the subroutine by a different mechanism than is
used to generate the call op. (Some forms of sigilless call
have other complications of a similar nature.) If an attempt
is made to call a Lexical::Var lexical subroutine via a
bareword on an older Perl, this module will probably still
be able to intercept the call op, and will throw an
exception to indicate that the parsing has gone wrong.
However, in some cases compilation goes further wrong before
this module can catch it, resulting in either a confusing
parse error or (in rare situations) silent compilation to an
incorrect op sequence. On Perl 5.11.2 and later, sigilless
subroutine calls work correctly, except for an issue noted
below.</p>
<p style="margin-left:9%; margin-top: 1em">Subroutine calls
that have neither sigil nor parentheses (around the argument
list) are subject to an ambiguity with indirect object
syntax. If the first argument expression begins with a
bareword or a scalar variable reference then the Perl parser
is liable to interpret the call as an indirect method call.
Normally this syntax would be interpreted as a subroutine
call if the subroutine exists, but the parser doesn't look
at lexically−defined subroutines for this purpose. The
call interpretation can be forced by prefixing the first
argument expression with a "+", or by wrapping the
whole argument list in parentheses.</p>
<p style="margin-left:9%; margin-top: 1em">In the earlier
Perl versions that support
"my"/"our"/"state"
subroutines, starting from Perl 5.17.4, the mechanism for
core lexical subroutines suffers a couple of bugs that mean
that Lexical::Var can't shadow subroutines declared that
way. This was fixed in Perl 5.19.1.</p>
<p style="margin-left:9%; margin-top: 1em">On Perls built
for threading (even if threading is not actually used),
scalar constants that are defined by literals in the Perl
source don't reliably maintain their object identity. What
appear to be multiple references to a single object can end
up behaving as references to multiple objects, in surprising
ways. The multiple objects all initially have the correct
value, but they can be writable even though the original
object is a constant. See Perl bug reports [perl #109744]
and [perl #109746]. This can affect objects that are placed
in the lexical namespace, just as it can affect those in
package namespaces or elsewhere. "Lexical::Var"
avoids contributing to the problem itself, but certain ways
of building the parameters to "Lexical::Var" can
result in the object in the lexical namespace not being the
one that was intended, or can damage the named object so
that later referencing operations on it misbehave.
Scalar::Construct can be used to avoid this problem.</p>
<p style="margin-left:9%; margin-top: 1em">Bogus
redefinition warnings occur in some cases when
"our" declarations and "Lexical::Var"
declarations shadow each other.</p>
<p style="margin-left:9%; margin-top: 1em">Package hash
entries get created for subroutine and glob names that are
used, even though the subroutines and globs are not actually
being stored or looked up in the package. This can
occasionally result in a "used only once" warning
failing to occur when it should.</p>
<p style="margin-left:9%; margin-top: 1em">On Perls prior
to 5.15.5, if this package's "import" or
"unimport" method is called from inside a string
"eval" inside a "BEGIN" block, it does
not have proper access to the compiling environment, and
will complain that it is being invoked outside compilation.
Calling from the body of a "require"d or
"do"ed file causes the same problem on the same
Perl versions. Other kinds of indirection within a
"BEGIN" block, such as calling via a normal
function, do not cause this problem.</p>
<p style="margin-left:9%; margin-top: 1em">When judging
whether the "unimport" method should hide a
subroutine, this module can't distinguish between a lexical
subroutine established by this module and a
"state" subroutine. This may change in the
future.</p>
