<h2>NAME
<a name="NAME"></a>
</h2>
<p style="margin-left:9%; margin-top: 1em">Locale::Maketext
− framework for localization</p>
<h2>SYNOPSIS
<a name="SYNOPSIS"></a>
</h2>
<p style="margin-left:9%; margin-top: 1em">package
MyProgram; <br/>
use strict; <br/>
use MyProgram::L10N; <br/>
# ...which inherits from Locale::Maketext <br/>
my $lh = MyProgram::L10N−&gt;get_handle() || die
"What language?"; <br/>
... <br/>
# And then any messages your program emits, like: <br/>
warn $lh−&gt;maketext( "Can't open file [_1]:
[_2]\n", $f, $! ); <br/>
...</p>
<h2>DESCRIPTION
<a name="DESCRIPTION"></a>
</h2>
<p style="margin-left:9%; margin-top: 1em">It is a common
feature of applications (whether run directly, or via the
Web) for them to be "localized" −−
i.e., for them to a present an English interface to an
English−speaker, a German interface to a
German−speaker, and so on for all languages it's
programmed with. Locale::Maketext is a framework for
software localization; it provides you with the tools for
organizing and accessing the bits of text and
text−processing code that you need for producing
localized applications.</p>
<p style="margin-left:9%; margin-top: 1em">In order to make
sense of Maketext and how all its components fit together,
you should probably go read Locale::Maketext::TPJ13, and
<i>then</i> read the following documentation.</p>
<p style="margin-left:9%; margin-top: 1em">You may also
want to read over the source for "File::Findgrep"
and its constituent modules −− they are a
complete (if small) example application that uses
Maketext.</p>
<h2>QUICK OVERVIEW
<a name="QUICK OVERVIEW"></a>
</h2>
<p style="margin-left:9%; margin-top: 1em">The basic design
of Locale::Maketext is object−oriented, and
Locale::Maketext is an abstract base class, from which you
derive a "project class". The project class (with
a name like "TkBocciBall::Localize", which you
then use in your module) is in turn the base class for all
the "language classes" for your project (with
names "TkBocciBall::Localize::it",
"TkBocciBall::Localize::en",
"TkBocciBall::Localize::fr", etc.).</p>
<p style="margin-left:9%; margin-top: 1em">A language class
is a class containing a lexicon of phrases as class data,
and possibly also some methods that are of use in
interpreting phrases in the lexicon, or otherwise dealing
with text in that language.</p>
<p style="margin-left:9%; margin-top: 1em">An object
belonging to a language class is called a "language
handle"; it's typically a flyweight object.</p>
<p style="margin-left:9%; margin-top: 1em">The normal
course of action is to call:</p>
<p style="margin-left:9%; margin-top: 1em">use
TkBocciBall::Localize; # the localization project class <br/>
$lh = TkBocciBall::Localize−&gt;get_handle(); <br/>
# Depending on the user's locale, etc., this will <br/>
# make a language handle from among the classes available,
<br/>
# and any defaults that you declare. <br/>
die "Couldn't make a language handle??" unless
$lh;</p>
<p style="margin-left:9%; margin-top: 1em">From then on,
you use the "maketext" function to access entries
in whatever lexicon(s) belong to the language handle you
got. So, this:</p>
<p style="margin-left:9%; margin-top: 1em">print
$lh−&gt;maketext("You won!"),
"\n";</p>
<p style="margin-left:9%; margin-top: 1em">...emits the
right text for this language. If the object in $lh belongs
to class "TkBocciBall::Localize::fr" and
%TkBocciBall::Localize::fr::Lexicon contains
"("You won!" =&gt; "Tu as
gagné!")", then the above code happily
tells the user "Tu as gagné!".</p>
<h2>METHODS
<a name="METHODS"></a>
</h2>
<p style="margin-left:9%; margin-top: 1em">Locale::Maketext
offers a variety of methods, which fall into three
categories:</p>

<tr align="left" valign="top">

<td width="1%">
<p>•</p></td>
<td width="4%"></td>
<td width="86%">
<p>Methods that you may find it handy to use, from routines
of yours that you put in %Lexicon entries.</p></td></tr>
</table>
<p style="margin-left:9%; margin-top: 1em">These are
covered in the following section.</p>
<h3>Construction Methods
<a name="Construction Methods"></a>
</h3>
<p style="margin-left:9%; margin-top: 1em">These are to do
with constructing a language handle:</p>
<table border="0" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" frame="void" rules="none" width="100%">
<tr align="left" valign="top">
<td width="9%"></td>
<td width="1%">
<p style="margin-top: 1em">•</p></td>
<td width="4%"></td>
<td width="72%">
<p style="margin-top: 1em">$lh =
YourProjClass−&gt;get_handle( ...langtags... ) || die
"lg−handle?";</p> </td>
<td width="14%">
</td></tr>
</table>
<p style="margin-left:14%; margin-top: 1em">This tries
loading classes based on the language−tags you give
(like "("en−US", "sk",
"kon", "es−MX", "ja",
"i−klingon")", and for the first class
that succeeds, returns
YourProjClass::<i>language</i>−&gt;<b>new()</b>.</p>
<p style="margin-left:14%; margin-top: 1em">If it runs thru
the entire given list of language−tags, and finds no
classes for those exact terms, it then tries
"superordinate" language classes. So if no
"en−US" class (i.e., YourProjClass::en_us)
was found, nor classes for anything else in that list, we
then try its superordinate, "en" (i.e.,
YourProjClass::en), and so on thru the other
language−tags in the given list: "es". (The
other language−tags in our example list: happen to
have no superordinates.)</p>
<p style="margin-left:14%; margin-top: 1em">If none of
those language−tags leads to loadable classes, we then
try classes derived from
YourProjClass−&gt;<b>fallback_languages()</b> and then
if nothing comes of that, we use classes named by
YourProjClass−&gt;<b>fallback_language_classes()</b>.
Then in the (probably quite unlikely) event that that fails,
we just return undef.</p>
<table border="0" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" frame="void" rules="none" width="100%">
<tr align="left" valign="top">
<td width="9%"></td>
<td width="1%">
<p style="margin-top: 1em">•</p></td>
<td width="4%"></td>
<td width="69%">
<p style="margin-top: 1em">$lh =
YourProjClass−&gt;get_handle<b>()</b> || die
"lg−handle?";</p> </td>
<td width="17%">
</td></tr>
</table>
<p style="margin-left:14%; margin-top: 1em">When
"get_handle" is called with an empty parameter
list, magic happens:</p>
<p style="margin-left:14%; margin-top: 1em">If
"get_handle" senses that it's running in program
that was invoked as a CGI, then it tries to get
language−tags out of the environment variable
"HTTP_ACCEPT_LANGUAGE", and it pretends that those
were the languages passed as parameters to
"get_handle".</p>
<p style="margin-left:14%; margin-top: 1em">Otherwise
(i.e., if not a CGI), this tries various OS−specific
ways to get the language−tags for the current
locale/language, and then pretends that those were the
value(s) passed to "get_handle".</p>
<p style="margin-left:14%; margin-top: 1em">Currently this
OS−specific stuff consists of looking in the
environment variables "LANG" and
"LANGUAGE"; and on MSWin machines (where those
variables are typically unused), this also tries using the
module Win32::Locale to get a language−tag for
whatever language/locale is currently selected in the
"Regional Settings" (or
"International"?) Control Panel. I welcome further
suggestions for making this do the Right Thing under other
operating systems that support localization.</p>
<p style="margin-left:14%; margin-top: 1em">If you're using
localization in an application that keeps a configuration
file, you might consider something like this in your project
class:</p>
<p style="margin-left:14%; margin-top: 1em">sub
get_handle_via_config { <br/>
my $class = $_[0]; <br/>
my $chosen_language = $Config_settings{'language'}; <br/>
my $lh; <br/>
if($chosen_language) { <br/>
$lh = $class−&gt;get_handle($chosen_language) <br/>
|| die "No language handle for
\"$chosen_language\"" <br/>
. " or the like"; <br/>
} else { <br/>
# Config file missing, maybe? <br/>
$lh = $class−&gt;get_handle() <br/>
|| die "Can't get a language handle"; <br/>
} <br/>
return $lh; <br/>
}</p>
<table border="0" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" frame="void" rules="none" width="100%">
<tr align="left" valign="top">
<td width="9%"></td>
<td width="1%">
<p style="margin-top: 1em">•</p></td>
<td width="4%"></td>
<td width="48%">
<p style="margin-top: 1em">$lh =
YourProjClass::langname−&gt;<b>new()</b>;</p> </td>
<td width="38%">
</td></tr>
</table>
<p style="margin-left:14%; margin-top: 1em">This constructs
a language handle. You usually <b>don't</b> call this
directly, but instead let "get_handle" find a
language class to "use" and to then call
−&gt;new on.</p>
<table border="0" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" frame="void" rules="none" width="100%">
<tr align="left" valign="top">
<td width="9%"></td>
<td width="1%">
<p style="margin-top: 1em">•</p></td>
<td width="4%"></td>
<td width="15%">
<p style="margin-top: 1em">$lh−&gt;<b>init()</b>;</p> </td>
<td width="71%">
</td></tr>
</table>
<p style="margin-left:14%; margin-top: 1em">This is called
by −&gt;new to initialize newly−constructed
language handles. If you define an init method in your
class, remember that it's usually considered a good idea to
call $lh−&gt;SUPER::init in it (presumably at the
beginning), so that all classes get a chance to initialize a
new object however they see fit.</p>
<table border="0" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" frame="void" rules="none" width="100%">
<tr align="left" valign="top">
<td width="9%"></td>

<td width="41%">
</td></tr>
</table>
<p style="margin-left:14%; margin-top: 1em">"get_handle"
appends the return value of this to the end of whatever list
of languages you pass "get_handle". Unless you
override this method, your project class will inherit
Locale::Maketext's "fallback_languages", which
currently returns "('i−default', 'en',
'en−US')". ("i−default" is
defined in RFC 2277).</p>
<p style="margin-left:14%; margin-top: 1em">This method (by
having it return the name of a language−tag that has
an existing language class) can be used for making sure that
"get_handle" will always manage to construct a
language handle (assuming your language classes are in an
appropriate @INC directory). Or you can use the next
method:</p>
<table border="0" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" frame="void" rules="none" width="100%">
<tr align="left" valign="top">
<td width="9%"></td>
<td width="1%">
<p style="margin-top: 1em">•</p></td>
<td width="4%"></td>
<td width="54%">
<p style="margin-top: 1em">YourProjClass−&gt;<b>fallback_language_classes()</b></p> </td>
<td width="32%">
</td></tr>
</table>
<p style="margin-left:14%; margin-top: 1em">"get_handle"
appends the return value of this to the end of the list of
classes it will try using. Unless you override this method,
your project class will inherit Locale::Maketext's
"fallback_language_classes", which currently
returns an empty list, "()". By setting this to
some value (namely, the name of a loadable language class),
you can be sure that "get_handle" will always
manage to construct a language handle.</p>
<h3>The "maketext" Method
<a name='The "maketext" Method'></a>
</h3>
<p style="margin-left:9%; margin-top: 1em">This is the most
important method in Locale::Maketext:</p>
<p style="margin-left:9%; margin-top: 1em">$text =
$lh−&gt;maketext(I&lt;key&gt;, ...parameters for this
phrase...);</p>
<p style="margin-left:9%; margin-top: 1em">This looks in
the %Lexicon of the language handle $lh and all its
superclasses, looking for an entry whose key is the string
<i>key</i>. Assuming such an entry is found, various things
then happen, depending on the value found:</p>
<p style="margin-left:9%; margin-top: 1em">If the value is
a scalarref, the scalar is dereferenced and returned (and
any parameters are ignored).</p>
<p style="margin-left:9%; margin-top: 1em">If the value is
a coderef, we return &amp;$value($lh, ...parameters...).</p>
<p style="margin-left:9%; margin-top: 1em">If the value is
a string that <i>doesn't</i> look like it's in Bracket
Notation, we return it (after replacing it with a scalarref,
in its %Lexicon).</p>
<p style="margin-left:9%; margin-top: 1em">If the value
<i>does</i> look like it's in Bracket Notation, then we
compile it into a sub, replace the string in the %Lexicon
with the new coderef, and then we return &amp;$new_sub($lh,
...parameters...).</p>
<p style="margin-left:9%; margin-top: 1em">Bracket Notation
is discussed in a later section. Note that trying to compile
a string into Bracket Notation can throw an exception if the
string is not syntactically valid (say, by not balancing
brackets right.)</p>
<p style="margin-left:9%; margin-top: 1em">Also, calling
&amp;$coderef($lh, ...parameters...) can throw any sort of
exception (if, say, code in that sub tries to divide by
zero). But a very common exception occurs when you have
Bracket Notation text that says to call a method
"foo", but there is no such method. (E.g.,
"You have [qua<b>tn</b>,_1,ball]." will throw an
exception on trying to call
$lh−&gt;qua<b>tn</b>($_[1],'ball') −− you
presumably meant "quant".) "maketext"
catches these exceptions, but only to make the error message
more readable, at which point it rethrows the exception.</p>
<p style="margin-left:9%; margin-top: 1em">An exception
<i>may</i> be thrown if <i>key</i> is not found in any of
$lh's %Lexicon hashes. What happens if a key is not found,
is discussed in a later section, "Controlling Lookup
Failure".</p>
<p style="margin-left:9%; margin-top: 1em">Note that you
might find it useful in some cases to override the
"maketext" method with an "after
method", if you want to translate encodings, or even
scripts:</p>
<p style="margin-left:9%; margin-top: 1em">package
YrProj::zh_cn; # Chinese with PRC−style glyphs <br/>
use base ('YrProj::zh_tw'); # Taiwan−style <br/>
sub maketext { <br/>
my $self = shift(@_); <br/>
my $value = $self−&gt;maketext(@_); <br/>
return Chineeze::taiwan2mainland($value); <br/>
}</p>
<p style="margin-left:9%; margin-top: 1em">Or you may want
to override it with something that traps any exceptions, if
that's critical to your program:</p>
<p style="margin-left:9%; margin-top: 1em">sub maketext {
<br/>
my($lh, @stuff) = @_; <br/>
my $out; <br/>
eval { $out = $lh−&gt;SUPER::maketext(@stuff) }; <br/>
return $out unless $@; <br/>
...otherwise deal with the exception... <br/>
}</p>
<p style="margin-left:9%; margin-top: 1em">Other than those
two situations, I don't imagine that it's useful to override
the "maketext" method. (If you run into a
situation where it is useful, I'd be interested in hearing
about it.) <br/>
$lh−&gt;fail_with <i>or</i>
$lh−&gt;fail_with(<i>PARAM</i>) <br/>
$lh−&gt;failure_handler_auto</p>
<p style="margin-left:14%;">These two methods are discussed
in the section "Controlling Lookup Failure".</p>
<p style="margin-left:9%;">$lh−&gt;denylist(@list)
&lt;or&gt; $lh−&gt;blacklist(@list) <br/>
$lh−&gt;allowlist(@list) &lt;or&gt;
$lh−&gt;whitelist(@list)</p>
<p style="margin-left:14%;">These methods are discussed in
the section "Bracket Notation Security".</p>
<h3>Utility Methods
<a name="Utility Methods"></a>
</h3>
<p style="margin-left:9%; margin-top: 1em">These are
methods that you may find it handy to use, generally from
%Lexicon routines of yours (whether expressed as Bracket
Notation or not). <br/>
$language−&gt;quant($number, $singular) <br/>
$language−&gt;quant($number, $singular, $plural) <br/>
$language−&gt;quant($number, $singular, $plural,
$negative)</p>
<p style="margin-left:14%;">This is generally meant to be
called from inside Bracket Notation (which is discussed
later), as in</p>
<p style="margin-left:14%; margin-top: 1em">"Your
search matched [quant,_1,document]!"</p>
<p style="margin-left:14%; margin-top: 1em">It's for
<i>quantifying</i> a noun (i.e., saying how much of it there
is, while giving the correct form of it). The behavior of
this method is handy for English and a few other Western
European languages, and you should override it for languages
where it's not suitable. You can feel free to read the
source, but the current implementation is basically as this
pseudocode describes:</p>
<p style="margin-left:14%; margin-top: 1em">if $number is 0
and there's a $negative, <br/>
return $negative; <br/>
elsif $number is 1, <br/>
return "1 $singular"; <br/>
elsif there's a $plural, <br/>
return "$number $plural"; <br/>
else <br/>
return "$number " . $singular . "s";
<br/>
# <br/>
# ...except that we actually call numf to <br/>
# stringify $number before returning it.</p>
<p style="margin-left:14%; margin-top: 1em">So for English
(with Bracket Notation) "...[quant,_1,file]..." is
fine (for 0 it returns "0 files", for 1 it returns
"1 file", and for more it returns "2
files", etc.)</p>
<p style="margin-left:14%; margin-top: 1em">But for
"directory", you'd want
"[quant,_1,directory,directories]" so that our
elementary "quant" method doesn't think that the
plural of "directory" is "directorys".
And you might find that the output may sound better if you
specify a negative form, as in:</p>
<p style="margin-left:14%; margin-top: 1em">"[quant,_1,file,files,No
files] matched your query.\n"</p>
<p style="margin-left:14%; margin-top: 1em">Remember to
keep in mind verb agreement (or adjectives too, in other
languages), as in:</p>
<p style="margin-left:14%; margin-top: 1em">"[quant,_1,document]
were matched.\n"</p>
<p style="margin-left:14%; margin-top: 1em">Because if _1
is one, you get "1 document <b>were</b> matched".
An acceptable hack here is to do something like this:</p>
<p style="margin-left:14%; margin-top: 1em">"[quant,_1,document
was, documents were] matched.\n"</p>
<p style="margin-left:9%;">$language−&gt;numf($number)</p>
<p style="margin-left:14%;">This returns the given number
formatted nicely according to this language's conventions.
Maketext's default method is mostly to just take the normal
string form of the number (applying sprintf "%G"
for only very large numbers), and then to add commas as
necessary. (Except that we apply "tr/,./.,/" if
$language−&gt;{'numf_comma'} is true; that's a bit of
a hack that's useful for languages that express two million
as "2.000.000" and not as
"2,000,000").</p>
<p style="margin-left:14%; margin-top: 1em">If you want
anything fancier, consider overriding this with something
that uses Number::Format, or does something else
entirely.</p>
<p style="margin-left:14%; margin-top: 1em">Note that numf
is called by quant for stringifying all quantifying
numbers.</p>
<p style="margin-left:9%;">$language−&gt;numerate($number,
$singular, $plural, $negative)</p>
<p style="margin-left:14%;">This returns the given noun
form which is appropriate for the quantity $number according
to this language's conventions. "numerate" is used
internally by "quant" to quantify nouns. Use it
directly −− usually from bracket notation
−− to avoid "quant"'s implicit call to
"numf" and output of a numeric quantity.</p>
<p style="margin-left:9%;">$language−&gt;sprintf($format,
@items)</p>
<p style="margin-left:14%;">This is just a wrapper around
Perl's normal "sprintf" function. It's provided so
that you can use "sprintf" in Bracket
Notation:</p>
<p style="margin-left:14%; margin-top: 1em">"Couldn't
access datanode
[sprintf,%10x=˜[%s˜],_1,_2]!\n"</p>
<p style="margin-left:14%; margin-top: 1em">returning...</p>
<p style="margin-left:14%; margin-top: 1em">Couldn't access
datanode Stuff=[thangamabob]!</p>
<p style="margin-left:9%;">$language−&gt;<b>language_tag()</b></p>
<p style="margin-left:14%;">Currently this just takes the
last bit of ref($language), turns underscores to dashes, and
returns it. So if $language is an object of class
Hee::HOO::Haw::en_us,
$language−&gt;<b>language_tag()</b> returns
"en−us". (Yes, the usual representation for
that language tag is "en−US", but case is
<i>never</i> considered meaningful in language−tag
comparison.)</p>
<p style="margin-left:14%; margin-top: 1em">You may
override this as you like; Maketext doesn't use it for
anything.</p>
<p style="margin-left:9%;">$language−&gt;<b>encoding()</b></p>
<p style="margin-left:14%;">Currently this isn't used for
anything, but it's provided (with default value of
"(ref($language) &amp;&amp;
$language−&gt;{'encoding'})) or
"iso−8859−1"" ) as a sort of
suggestion that it may be useful/necessary to associate
encodings with your language handles (whether on a
per−class or even per−handle basis.)</p>
<h3>Language Handle Attributes and Internals
<a name="Language Handle Attributes and Internals"></a>
</h3>
<p style="margin-left:9%; margin-top: 1em">A language
handle is a flyweight object −− i.e., it doesn't
(necessarily) carry any data of interest, other than just
being a member of whatever class it belongs to.</p>
<p style="margin-left:9%; margin-top: 1em">A language
handle is implemented as a blessed hash. Subclasses of yours
can store whatever data you want in the hash. Currently the
only hash entry used by any crucial Maketext method is
"fail", so feel free to use anything else as you
like.</p>
<p style="margin-left:9%; margin-top: 1em"><b>Remember:
Don't be afraid to read the Maketext source if there's any
point on which this documentation is unclear.</b> This
documentation is vastly longer than the module source
itself.</p>

<b>doesn't matter</b> how you name this class, although
assuming this is the localization component of your Super
Mega Program, good names for your project class might be
SuperMegaProgram::Localization, SuperMegaProgram::L10N,
SuperMegaProgram::I18N, SuperMegaProgram::International, or

<h2>ENTRIES IN EACH LEXICON
<a name="ENTRIES IN EACH LEXICON"></a>
</h2>
<p style="margin-left:9%; margin-top: 1em">A typical
%Lexicon entry is meant to signify a phrase, taking some
number (0 or more) of parameters. An entry is meant to be
accessed by via a string <i>key</i> in
$lh−&gt;maketext(<i>key</i>, ...parameters...), which
should return a string that is generally meant for be used
for "output" to the user −− regardless
of whether this actually means printing to STDOUT, writing
to a file, or putting into a GUI widget.</p>
<p style="margin-left:9%; margin-top: 1em">While the key
must be a string value (since that's a basic restriction
that Perl places on hash keys), the value in the lexicon can
currently be of several types: a defined scalar, scalarref,
or coderef. The use of these is explained above, in the
section 'The "maketext" Method', and Bracket
Notation for strings is discussed in the next section.</p>
<p style="margin-left:9%; margin-top: 1em">While you can
use arbitrary unique IDs for lexicon keys (like
"_min_larger_max_error"), it is often useful for
if an entry's key is itself a valid value, like this example
error message:</p>
<p style="margin-left:9%; margin-top: 1em">"Minimum
([_1]) is larger than maximum ([_2])!\n",</p>
<p style="margin-left:9%; margin-top: 1em">Compare this
code that uses an arbitrary ID...</p>
<p style="margin-left:9%; margin-top: 1em">die
$lh−&gt;maketext( "_min_larger_max_error",
$min, $max ) <br/>
if $min &gt; $max;</p>
<p style="margin-left:9%; margin-top: 1em">...to this code
that uses a key−as−value:</p>
<p style="margin-left:9%; margin-top: 1em">die
$lh−&gt;maketext( <br/>
"Minimum ([_1]) is larger than maximum ([_2])!\n",
<br/>
$min, $max <br/>
) if $min &gt; $max;</p>
<p style="margin-left:9%; margin-top: 1em">The second is,
in short, more readable. In particular, it's obvious that
the number of parameters you're feeding to that phrase (two)
is the number of parameters that it <i>wants</i> to be fed.
(Since you see _1 and a _2 being used in the key there.)</p>
<p style="margin-left:9%; margin-top: 1em">Also, once a
project is otherwise complete and you start to localize it,
you can scrape together all the various keys you use, and
pass it to a translator; and then the translator's work will
go faster if what he's presented is this:</p>
<p style="margin-left:9%; margin-top: 1em">"Minimum
([_1]) is larger than maximum ([_2])!\n", <br/>
=&gt; "", # fill in something here, Jacques!</p>
<p style="margin-left:9%; margin-top: 1em">rather than this
more cryptic mess:</p>
<p style="margin-left:9%; margin-top: 1em">"_min_larger_max_error"
<br/>
=&gt; "", # fill in something here, Jacques</p>
<p style="margin-left:9%; margin-top: 1em">I think that
keys as lexicon values makes the completed lexicon entries
more readable:</p>
<p style="margin-left:9%; margin-top: 1em">"Minimum
([_1]) is larger than maximum ([_2])!\n", <br/>
=&gt; "Le minimum ([_1]) est plus grand que le maximum
([_2])!\n",</p>
<p style="margin-left:9%; margin-top: 1em">Also, having
valid values as keys becomes very useful if you set up an
_AUTO lexicon. _AUTO lexicons are discussed in a later
section.</p>
<p style="margin-left:9%; margin-top: 1em">I almost always
use keys that are themselves valid lexicon values. One
notable exception is when the value is quite long. For
example, to get the screenful of data that a
command−line program might return when given an
unknown switch, I often just use a brief,
self−explanatory key such as
"_USAGE_MESSAGE". At that point I then go and
immediately to define that lexicon entry in the
ProjectClass::L10N::en lexicon (since English is always my
"project language"):</p>
<p style="margin-left:9%; margin-top: 1em">'_USAGE_MESSAGE'
=&gt; &lt;&lt;'EOSTUFF', <br/>
...long long message... <br/>
EOSTUFF</p>
<p style="margin-left:9%; margin-top: 1em">and then I can
use it as:</p>
<p style="margin-left:9%; margin-top: 1em">getopt('oDI',
\%opts) or die $lh−&gt;maketext('_USAGE_MESSAGE');</p>
<p style="margin-left:9%; margin-top: 1em">Incidentally,
note that each class's %Lexicon
inherits−and−extends the lexicons in its
superclasses. This is not because these are special hashes
<i>per se</i>, but because you access them via the
"maketext" method, which looks for entries across
all the %Lexicon hashes in a language class <i>and</i> all
its ancestor classes. (This is because the idea of
"class data" isn't directly implemented in Perl,
but is instead left to individual class−systems to
implement as they see fit..)</p>
<p style="margin-left:9%; margin-top: 1em">Note that you
may have things stored in a lexicon besides just phrases for
output: for example, if your program takes input from the
keyboard, asking a "(Y/N)" question, you probably
need to know what the equivalent of "Y[es]/N[o]"
is in whatever language. You probably also need to know what
the equivalents of the answers "y" and
"n" are. You can store that information in the
lexicon (say, under the keys "˜answer_y" and
"˜answer_n", and the long forms as
"˜answer_yes" and
"˜answer_no", where "˜" is
just an ad−hoc character meant to indicate to
programmers/translators that these are not phrases for
output).</p>
<p style="margin-left:9%; margin-top: 1em">Or instead of
storing this in the language class's lexicon, you can (and,
in some cases, really should) represent the same bit of
knowledge as code in a method in the language class. (That
leaves a tidy distinction between the lexicon as the things
we know how to <i>say</i>, and the rest of the things in the
lexicon class as things that we know how to <i>do</i>.)
Consider this example of a processor for responses to French
"oui/non" questions:</p>
<p style="margin-left:9%; margin-top: 1em">sub y_or_n {
<br/>
return undef unless defined $_[1] and length $_[1]; <br/>
my $answer = lc $_[1]; # smash case <br/>
return 1 if $answer eq 'o' or $answer eq 'oui'; <br/>
return 0 if $answer eq 'n' or $answer eq 'non'; <br/>
return undef; <br/>
}</p>
<p style="margin-left:9%; margin-top: 1em">...which you'd
then call in a construct like this:</p>
<p style="margin-left:9%; margin-top: 1em">my $response;
<br/>
until(defined $response) { <br/>
print $lh−&gt;maketext("Open the pod bay door
(y/n)? "); <br/>
$response = $lh−&gt;y_or_n(
get_input_from_keyboard_somehow() ); <br/>
} <br/>
if($response) { $pod_bay_door−&gt;open() } <br/>
else { $pod_bay_door−&gt;leave_closed() }</p>
<p style="margin-left:9%; margin-top: 1em">Other data worth
storing in a lexicon might be things like filenames for
language−targetted resources:</p>
<p style="margin-left:9%; margin-top: 1em">... <br/>
"_main_splash_png" <br/>
=&gt; "/styles/en_us/main_splash.png", <br/>
"_main_splash_imagemap" <br/>
=&gt; "/styles/en_us/main_splash.incl", <br/>
"_general_graphics_path" <br/>
=&gt; "/styles/en_us/", <br/>
"_alert_sound" <br/>
=&gt; "/styles/en_us/hey_there.wav", <br/>
"_forward_icon" <br/>
=&gt; "left_arrow.png", <br/>
"_backward_icon" <br/>
=&gt; "right_arrow.png", <br/>
# In some other languages, left equals <br/>
# BACKwards, and right is FOREwards. <br/>
...</p>
<p style="margin-left:9%; margin-top: 1em">You might want
to do the same thing for expressing key bindings or the like
(since hardwiring "q" as the binding for the
function that quits a screen/menu/program is useful only if
your language happens to associate "q" with
"quit"!)</p>
<h2>BRACKET NOTATION
<a name="BRACKET NOTATION"></a>
</h2>
<p style="margin-left:9%; margin-top: 1em">Bracket Notation
is a crucial feature of Locale::Maketext. I mean Bracket
Notation to provide a replacement for the use of sprintf
formatting. Everything you do with Bracket Notation could be
done with a sub block, but bracket notation is meant to be
much more concise.</p>
<p style="margin-left:9%; margin-top: 1em">Bracket Notation
is a like a miniature "template" system (in the
sense of Text::Template, not in the sense of C++ templates),
where normal text is passed thru basically as is, but text
in special regions is specially interpreted. In Bracket
Notation, you use square brackets ("[...]"), not
curly braces ("{...}") to note sections that are
specially interpreted.</p>
<p style="margin-left:9%; margin-top: 1em">For example,
here all the areas that are taken literally are underlined
with a "ˆ", and all the in−bracket
special regions are underlined with an X:</p>
<p style="margin-left:9%; margin-top: 1em">"Minimum
([_1]) is larger than maximum ([_2])!\n", <br/>
ˆˆˆˆˆˆˆˆˆ XX
ˆˆˆˆˆˆˆˆˆˆˆˆˆˆˆˆˆˆˆˆˆˆˆˆˆˆ
XX ˆˆˆˆ</p>
<p style="margin-left:9%; margin-top: 1em">When that string
is compiled from bracket notation into a real Perl sub, it's
basically turned into:</p>
<p style="margin-left:9%; margin-top: 1em">sub { <br/>
my $lh = $_[0]; <br/>
my @params = @_; <br/>
return join '', <br/>
"Minimum (", <br/>
...some code here... <br/>
") is larger than maximum (", <br/>
...some code here... <br/>
")!\n", <br/>
} <br/>
# to be called by $lh−&gt;maketext(KEY, params...)</p>
<p style="margin-left:9%; margin-top: 1em">In other words,
text outside bracket groups is turned into string literals.
Text in brackets is rather more complex, and currently
follows these rules:</p>
<table border="0" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" frame="void" rules="none" width="100%">
<tr align="left" valign="top">
<td width="9%"></td>
<td width="1%">
<p style="margin-top: 1em">•</p></td>
<td width="4%"></td>
<td width="86%">
<p style="margin-top: 1em">Bracket groups that are empty,
or which consist only of whitespace, are ignored. (Examples:
"[]", "[ ]", or a [ and a ] with returns
and/or tabs and/or spaces between them.</p></td></tr>
</table>
<p style="margin-left:14%; margin-top: 1em">Otherwise, each
group is taken to be a comma−separated group of items,

<p>•</p></td>
<td width="4%"></td>
<td width="86%">

invalid. For example, in the group
"[!@#,whatever]", the first item "!@#"
is neither the empty−string,
"_<i>number</i>",
"_−<i>number</i>", "_*", nor a
valid method name; and so Locale::Maketext will throw an
exception of you try compiling an expression containing this
bracket group.</p></td></tr>
</table>
<p style="margin-left:9%; margin-top: 1em">Note,
incidentally, that items in each group are
comma−separated, not
"/\s*,\s*/"−separated. That is, you might
expect that this bracket group:</p>
<p style="margin-left:9%; margin-top: 1em">"Hoohah
[foo, _1 , bar ,baz]!"</p>
<p style="margin-left:9%; margin-top: 1em">would compile to
this:</p>
<p style="margin-left:9%; margin-top: 1em">sub { <br/>
my $lh = $_[0]; <br/>
return join '', <br/>
"Hoohah ", <br/>
$lh−&gt;foo( $_[1], "bar", "baz"),
<br/>
"!", <br/>
}</p>
<p style="margin-left:9%; margin-top: 1em">But it actually
compiles as this:</p>
<p style="margin-left:9%; margin-top: 1em">sub { <br/>
my $lh = $_[0]; <br/>
return join '', <br/>
"Hoohah ", <br/>
$lh−&gt;foo(" _1 ", " bar ",
"baz"), # note the &lt;space&gt; in " bar
" <br/>
"!", <br/>
}</p>
<p style="margin-left:9%; margin-top: 1em">In the notation
discussed so far, the characters "[" and
"]" are given special meaning, for opening and
closing bracket groups, and "," has a special
meaning inside bracket groups, where it separates items in
the group. This begs the question of how you'd express a
literal "[" or "]" in a Bracket Notation
string, and how you'd express a literal comma inside a
bracket group. For this purpose I've adopted
"˜" (tilde) as an escape character:
"˜[" means a literal '[' character anywhere
in Bracket Notation (i.e., regardless of whether you're in a
bracket group or not), and ditto for "˜]"
meaning a literal ']', and "˜," meaning a
literal comma. (Altho "," means a literal comma
outside of bracket groups −− it's only inside
bracket groups that commas are special.)</p>
<p style="margin-left:9%; margin-top: 1em">And on the off
chance you need a literal tilde in a bracket expression, you
get it with "˜˜".</p>
<p style="margin-left:9%; margin-top: 1em">Currently, an
unescaped "˜" before a character other than a
bracket or a comma is taken to mean just a
"˜" and that character. I.e.,
"˜X" means the same as
"˜˜X" −− i.e., one literal
tilde, and then one literal "X". However, by using
"˜X", you are assuming that no future version
of Maketext will use "˜X" as a magic escape
sequence. In practice this is not a great problem, since
first off you can just write "˜˜X" and
not worry about it; second off, I doubt I'll add lots of new
magic characters to bracket notation; and third off, you
aren't likely to want literal "˜" characters
in your messages anyway, since it's not a character with
wide use in natural language text.</p>
<p style="margin-left:9%; margin-top: 1em">Brackets must be
balanced −− every openbracket must have one
matching closebracket, and vice versa. So these are all
<b>invalid</b>:</p>

"I ate [quant,_1,rhubarb pie[." <br/>
"I ate quant,_1,rhubarb pie]." <br/>
"I ate quant,_1,rhubarb pie[."</p>
<p style="margin-left:9%; margin-top: 1em">Currently,
bracket groups do not nest. That is, you <b>cannot</b>
say:</p>
<p style="margin-left:9%; margin-top: 1em">"Foo
[bar,baz,[quux,quuux]]\n";</p>
<p style="margin-left:9%; margin-top: 1em">If you need a
notation that's that powerful, use normal Perl:</p>

"bar" method so you don't need to pass it the
output from calling quux.</p>

<h2>BRACKET NOTATION SECURITY
<a name="BRACKET NOTATION SECURITY"></a>
</h2>
<p style="margin-left:9%; margin-top: 1em">Locale::Maketext
does not use any special syntax to differentiate bracket
notation methods from normal class or object methods. This
design makes it vulnerable to format string attacks whenever
it is used to process strings provided by untrusted
users.</p>
<p style="margin-left:9%; margin-top: 1em">Locale::Maketext
does support denylist and allowlist functionality to limit
which methods may be called as bracket notation methods.</p>
<p style="margin-left:9%; margin-top: 1em">By default,
Locale::Maketext denies all methods in the Locale::Maketext
namespace that begin with the '_' character, and all methods
which include Perl's namespace separator characters.</p>
<p style="margin-left:9%; margin-top: 1em">The default
denylist for Locale::Maketext also prevents use of the
following methods in bracket notation:</p>
<p style="margin-left:9%; margin-top: 1em">denylist <br/>
encoding <br/>
fail_with <br/>
failure_handler_auto <br/>
fallback_language_classes <br/>
fallback_languages <br/>
get_handle <br/>
init <br/>
language_tag <br/>
maketext <br/>
new <br/>
allowlist <br/>
whitelist <br/>
blacklist</p>
<p style="margin-left:9%; margin-top: 1em">This list can be
extended by either deny−listing additional "known
bad" methods, or allow−listing only "known
good" methods.</p>
<p style="margin-left:9%; margin-top: 1em">To prevent
specific methods from being called in bracket notation, use
the <b>denylist()</b> method:</p>
<p style="margin-left:9%; margin-top: 1em">my $lh =
MyProgram::L10N−&gt;get_handle(); <br/>
$lh−&gt;denylist(qw{my_internal_method
my_other_method}); <br/>
$lh−&gt;maketext('[my_internal_method]'); # dies</p>
<p style="margin-left:9%; margin-top: 1em">To limit the
allowed bracked notation methods to a specific list, use the
<b>allowlist()</b> method:</p>
<p style="margin-left:9%; margin-top: 1em">my $lh =
MyProgram::L10N−&gt;get_handle(); <br/>
$lh−&gt;allowlist('numerate', 'numf'); <br/>
$lh−&gt;maketext('[_1] [numerate, _1,shoe,shoes]',
12); # works <br/>
$lh−&gt;maketext('[my_internal_method]'); # dies</p>
<p style="margin-left:9%; margin-top: 1em">The
<b>denylist()</b> and <b>allowlist()</b> methods extend
their internal lists whenever they are called. To reset the
denylist or allowlist, create a new maketext object.</p>
<p style="margin-left:9%; margin-top: 1em">my $lh =
MyProgram::L10N−&gt;get_handle(); <br/>
$lh−&gt;denylist('numerate'); <br/>
$lh−&gt;denylist('numf'); <br/>
$lh−&gt;maketext('[_1] [numerate,_1,shoe,shoes]', 12);
# dies</p>
<p style="margin-left:9%; margin-top: 1em">For lexicons
that use an internal cache, translations which have already
been cached in their compiled form are not affected by
subsequent changes to the allowlist or denylist settings.
Lexicons that use an external cache will have their cache
cleared whenever the allowlist or denylist settings change.
The difference between the two types of caching is explained
in the "Readonly Lexicons" section.</p>
<p style="margin-left:9%; margin-top: 1em">Methods
disallowed by the denylist cannot be permitted by the
allowlist.</p>
<p style="margin-left:9%; margin-top: 1em">NOTE:
<b>denylist()</b> is the preferred method name to use
instead of the historical and non−inclusive method
<b>blacklist()</b>. <b>blacklist()</b> may be removed in a
future release of this package and so it's use should be
removed from usage.</p>

<h2>AUTO LEXICONS
<a name="AUTO LEXICONS"></a>
</h2>
<p style="margin-left:9%; margin-top: 1em">If maketext goes
to look in an individual %Lexicon for an entry for
<i>key</i> (where <i>key</i> does not start with an
underscore), and sees none, <b>but does see</b> an entry of
"_AUTO" =&gt; <i>some_true_value</i>, then we
actually define $Lexicon{<i>key</i>} = <i>key</i> right then
and there, and then use that value as if it had been there
all along. This happens before we even look in any
superclass %Lexicons!</p>
<p style="margin-left:9%; margin-top: 1em">(This is meant
to be somewhat like the AUTOLOAD mechanism in Perl's
function call system −− or, looked at another
way, like the AutoLoader module.)</p>
<p style="margin-left:9%; margin-top: 1em">I can picture
all sorts of circumstances where you just do not want lookup
to be able to fail (since failing normally means that
maketext throws a "die", although see the next
section for greater control over that). But here's one
circumstance where _AUTO lexicons are meant to be
<i>especially</i> useful:</p>
<p style="margin-left:9%; margin-top: 1em">As you're
writing an application, you decide as you go what messages
you need to emit. Normally you'd go to write this:</p>
<p style="margin-left:9%; margin-top: 1em">if(−e
$filename) { <br/>
go_process_file($filename) <br/>
} else { <br/>
print qq{Couldn't find file "$filename"!\n}; <br/>
}</p>
<p style="margin-left:9%; margin-top: 1em">but since you
anticipate localizing this, you write:</p>
<p style="margin-left:9%; margin-top: 1em">use
ThisProject::I18N; <br/>
my $lh = ThisProject::I18N−&gt;get_handle(); <br/>
# For the moment, assume that things are set up so <br/>
# that we load class ThisProject::I18N::en <br/>
# and that that's the class that $lh belongs to. <br/>
... <br/>
if(−e $filename) { <br/>
go_process_file($filename) <br/>
} else { <br/>
print $lh−&gt;maketext( <br/>
qq{Couldn't find file "[_1]"!\n}, $filename <br/>
); <br/>
}</p>
<p style="margin-left:9%; margin-top: 1em">Now, right after
you've just written the above lines, you'd normally have to
go open the file ThisProject/I18N/en.pm, and immediately add
an entry:</p>
<p style="margin-left:9%; margin-top: 1em">"Couldn't
find file \"[_1]\"!\n" <br/>
=&gt; "Couldn't find file
\"[_1]\"!\n",</p>
<p style="margin-left:9%; margin-top: 1em">But I consider
that somewhat of a distraction from the work of getting the
main code working −− to say nothing of the fact
that I often have to play with the program a few times
before I can decide exactly what wording I want in the
messages (which in this case would require me to go changing
three lines of code: the call to maketext with that key, and
then the two lines in ThisProject/I18N/en.pm).</p>
<p style="margin-left:9%; margin-top: 1em">However, if you
set "_AUTO =&gt; 1" in the %Lexicon in,
ThisProject/I18N/en.pm (assuming that English (en) is the
language that all your programmers will be using for this
project's internal message keys), then you don't ever have
to go adding lines like this</p>
<p style="margin-left:9%; margin-top: 1em">"Couldn't
find file \"[_1]\"!\n" <br/>
=&gt; "Couldn't find file
\"[_1]\"!\n",</p>
<p style="margin-left:9%; margin-top: 1em">to
ThisProject/I18N/en.pm, because if _AUTO is true there, then
just looking for an entry with the key "Couldn't find
file \"[_1]\"!\n" in that lexicon will cause
it to be added, with that value!</p>
<p style="margin-left:9%; margin-top: 1em">Note that the
reason that keys that start with "_" are immune to
_AUTO isn't anything generally magical about the underscore
character −− I just wanted a way to have most
lexicon keys be autoable, except for possibly a few, and I
arbitrarily decided to use a leading underscore as a signal
to distinguish those few.</p>
<h2>READONLY LEXICONS
<a name="READONLY LEXICONS"></a>
</h2>
<p style="margin-left:9%; margin-top: 1em">If your lexicon
is a tied hash the simple act of caching the compiled value
can be fatal.</p>
<p style="margin-left:9%; margin-top: 1em">For example a

like:</p>
<p style="margin-left:9%; margin-top: 1em">gdbm store

<p style="margin-left:9%; margin-top: 1em">All you need to
do is turn on caching outside of the lexicon hash itself
like so:</p>
<p style="margin-left:9%; margin-top: 1em">sub init { <br/>

... <br/>
$lh−&gt;{'use_external_lex_cache'} = 1; <br/>

<h2>CONTROLLING LOOKUP FAILURE
<a name="CONTROLLING LOOKUP FAILURE"></a>
</h2>
<p style="margin-left:9%; margin-top: 1em">If you call
$lh−&gt;maketext(<i>key</i>, ...parameters...), and
there's no entry <i>key</i> in $lh's class's %Lexicon, nor
in the superclass %Lexicon hash, <i>and</i> if we can't
auto−make <i>key</i> (because either it starts with a
"_", or because none of its lexicons have
"_AUTO =&gt; 1,"), then we have failed to find a
normal way to maketext <i>key</i>. What then happens in
these failure conditions, depends on the $lh object's
"fail" attribute.</p>
<p style="margin-left:9%; margin-top: 1em">If the language
handle has no "fail" attribute, maketext will
simply throw an exception (i.e., it calls "die",
mentioning the <i>key</i> whose lookup failed, and naming
the line number where the calling
$lh−&gt;maketext(<i>key</i>,...) was.</p>
<p style="margin-left:9%; margin-top: 1em">If the language
handle has a "fail" attribute whose value is a
coderef, then
$lh−&gt;maketext(<i>key</i>,...params...) gives up and
calls:</p>
<p style="margin-left:9%; margin-top: 1em">return
$that_subref−&gt;($lh, $key, @params);</p>
<p style="margin-left:9%; margin-top: 1em">Otherwise, the
"fail" attribute's value should be a string
denoting a method name, so that
$lh−&gt;maketext(<i>key</i>,...params...) can give up
with:</p>
<p style="margin-left:9%; margin-top: 1em">return
$lh−&gt;$that_method_name($phrase, @params);</p>
<p style="margin-left:9%; margin-top: 1em">The
"fail" attribute can be accessed with the
"fail_with" method:</p>
<p style="margin-left:9%; margin-top: 1em"># Set to a
coderef: <br/>
$lh−&gt;fail_with( \&amp;failure_handler ); <br/>
# Set to a method name: <br/>
$lh−&gt;fail_with( 'failure_method' ); <br/>
# Set to nothing (i.e., so failure throws a plain exception)
<br/>
$lh−&gt;fail_with( undef ); <br/>
# Get the current value <br/>
$handler = $lh−&gt;fail_with();</p>
<p style="margin-left:9%; margin-top: 1em">Now, as to what
you may want to do with these handlers: Maybe you'd want to
log what key failed for what class, and then die. Maybe you
don't like "die" and instead you want to send the
error message to STDOUT (or wherever) and then merely
exit().</p>
<p style="margin-left:9%; margin-top: 1em">Or maybe you
don't want to "die" at all! Maybe you could use a
handler like this:</p>
<p style="margin-left:9%; margin-top: 1em"># Make all
lookups fall back onto an English value, <br/>
# but only after we log it for later fingerpointing. <br/>
my $lh_backup = ThisProject−&gt;get_handle('en'); <br/>
open(LEX_FAIL_LOG, "&gt;&gt;wherever/lex.log") ||
die "GNAARGH $!"; <br/>
sub lex_fail { <br/>
my($failing_lh, $key, $params) = @_; <br/>
print LEX_FAIL_LOG scalar(localtime), "\t", <br/>
ref($failing_lh), "\t", $key, "\n"; <br/>
return $lh_backup−&gt;maketext($key,@params); <br/>
}</p>
<p style="margin-left:9%; margin-top: 1em">Some users have
expressed that they think this whole mechanism of having a
"fail" attribute at all, seems a rather pointless
complication. But I want Locale::Maketext to be usable for
software projects of <i>any</i> scale and type; and
different software projects have different ideas of what the
right thing is to do in failure conditions. I could simply
say that failure always throws an exception, and that if you
want to be careful, you'll just have to wrap every call to
$lh−&gt;maketext in an eval { }. However, I
want programmers to reserve the right (via the
"fail" attribute) to treat lookup failure as
something other than an exception of the same level of
severity as a config file being unreadable, or some
essential resource being inaccessible.</p>
<p style="margin-left:9%; margin-top: 1em">One possibly
useful value for the "fail" attribute is the
method name "failure_handler_auto". This is a
method defined in the class Locale::Maketext itself. You set
it with:</p>
<p style="margin-left:9%; margin-top: 1em">$lh−&gt;fail_with('failure_handler_auto');</p>
<p style="margin-left:9%; margin-top: 1em">Then when you
call $lh−&gt;maketext(<i>key</i>, ...parameters...)
and there's no <i>key</i> in any of those lexicons, maketext
gives up with</p>
<p style="margin-left:9%; margin-top: 1em">return
$lh−&gt;failure_handler_auto($key, @params);</p>
<p style="margin-left:9%; margin-top: 1em">But
failure_handler_auto, instead of dying or anything, compiles
$key, caching it in</p>
<p style="margin-left:9%; margin-top: 1em">$lh−&gt;{'failure_lex'}{$key}
= $compiled</p>
<p style="margin-left:9%; margin-top: 1em">and then calls
the compiled value, and returns that. (I.e., if $key looks
like bracket notation, $compiled is a sub, and we return
&amp;{$compiled}(@params); but if $key is just a plain
string, we just return that.)</p>
<p style="margin-left:9%; margin-top: 1em">The effect of
using "failure_auto_handler" is like an AUTO
lexicon, except that it 1) compiles $key even if it starts
with "_", and 2) you have a record in the new
hashref $lh−&gt;{'failure_lex'} of all the keys that
have failed for this object. This should avoid your program
dying −− as long as your keys aren't actually
invalid as bracket code, and as long as they don't try
calling methods that don't exist.</p>
<p style="margin-left:9%; margin-top: 1em">"failure_auto_handler"
may not be exactly what you want, but I hope it at least
shows you that maketext failure can be mitigated in any
number of very flexible ways. If you can formalize exactly
what you want, you should be able to express that as a
failure handler. You can even make it default for every
object of a given class, by setting it in that class's
init:</p>
<p style="margin-left:9%; margin-top: 1em">sub init { <br/>
my $lh = $_[0]; # a newborn handle <br/>
$lh−&gt;SUPER::init(); <br/>
$lh−&gt;fail_with('my_clever_failure_handler'); <br/>
return; <br/>
} <br/>

have all the messages explicitly in the lexicon (or else
you'd be getting exceptions thrown when you call
$lh−&gt;maketext to get messages that aren't in
there). But if you were (advisedly) lazy and are using an
_AUTO lexicon, then you've got to make a list of all the
phrases that you've so far been letting _AUTO generate for
you. There are very many ways to assemble such a list. The
most straightforward is to simply grep the source for every

rethinking things that you thought quite clear: should
"Edit" on a toolbar be a noun
("editing") or a verb ("to edit")? Is
there already a conventionalized way to express that menu
option, separate from the target language's normal word for
"to edit"?</p>
<p style="margin-left:14%; margin-top: 1em">In all cases
where the very common phenomenon of quantification (saying
"<i>N</i> files", for <b>any</b> value of N) is
involved, each translator should make clear what
dependencies the number causes in the sentence. In many
cases, dependency is limited to words adjacent to the
number, in places where you might expect them ("I found
the−?PLURAL <i>N</i> empty−?PLURAL
directory−?PLURAL"), but in some cases there are
unexpected dependencies ("I found−?PLURAL
..."!) as well as long−distance dependencies
"The <i>N</i> directory−?PLURAL could not be
deleted−?PLURAL"!).</p>
<p style="margin-left:14%; margin-top: 1em">Remind the
translators to consider the case where N is 0: "0 files
found" isn't exactly natural−sounding in any
language, but it may be unacceptable in many −−
or it may condition special kinds of agreement (similar to
English "I didN'T find ANY files").</p>
<p style="margin-left:14%; margin-top: 1em">Remember to ask
your translators about numeral formatting in their language,
so that you can override the "numf" method as
appropriate. Typical variables in number formatting are:
what to use as a decimal point (comma? period?); what to use
as a thousands separator (space? nonbreaking space? comma?
period? small middot? prime? apostrophe?); and even whether
the so−called "thousands separator" is
actually for every third digit −− I've heard
reports of two hundred thousand being expressible as
"2,00,000" for some Indian (Subcontinental)
languages, besides the less surprising
"200 000", "200.000",
"200,000", and "200'000". Also, using a
set of numeral glyphs other than the usual ASCII
"0"−"9" might be appreciated, as
via "tr/0−9/\x{0966}−\x{096F}/" for
getting digits in Devanagari script (for Hindi, Konkani,
others).</p>
<p style="margin-left:14%; margin-top: 1em">The basic
"quant" method that Locale::Maketext provides
should be good for many languages. For some languages, it
might be useful to modify it (or its constituent
"numerate" method) to take a plural form in the
two−argument call to "quant" (as in
"[quant,_1,files]") if it's all−around
easier to infer the singular form from the plural, than to
infer the plural form from the singular.</p>
<p style="margin-left:14%; margin-top: 1em">But for other
languages (as is discussed at length in
Locale::Maketext::TPJ13), simple
"quant"/"numf" is not enough. For the
particularly problematic Slavic languages, what you may need
is a method which you provide with the number, the citation
form of the noun to quantify, and the case and gender that
the sentence's syntax projects onto that noun slot. The
method would then be responsible for determining what
grammatical number that numeral projects onto its noun
phrase, and what case and gender it may override the normal
case and gender with; and then it would look up the noun in
a lexicon providing all needed inflected forms.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">You may also wish to discuss
with the translators the question of how to relate different
subforms of the same language tag, considering how this
reacts with "get_handle"'s treatment of these. For
example, if a user accepts interfaces in "en, fr",
and you have interfaces available in "en−US"
and "fr", what should they get? You may wish to
resolve this by establishing that "en" and
"en−US" are effectively synonymous, by
having one class zero−derive from the other.</p></td></tr>

<p style="margin-left:14%; margin-top: 1em">For some
languages this issue may never come up (Danish is rarely
expressed as "da−DK", but instead is just
"da"). And for other languages, the whole concept
of a "generic" form may verge on being uselessly
vague, particularly for interfaces involving voice media in
forms of Arabic or Chinese.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Once you've localized your
program/site/etc. for all desired languages, be sure to show
the result (whether live, or via screenshots) to the
translators. Once they approve, make every effort to have it
then checked by at least one other speaker of that language.
This holds true even when (or especially when) the
translation is done by one of your own programmers. Some
kinds of systems may be harder to find testers for than
others, depending on the amount of domain−specific
jargon and concepts involved −− it's easier to
find people who can tell you whether they approve of your
translation for "delete this message" in an
email−via−Web interface, than to find people who
can give you an informed opinion on your translation for
"attribute value" in an XML query tool's
interface.</p> </td></tr>
