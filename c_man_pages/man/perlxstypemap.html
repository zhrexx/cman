<h2>NAME
<a name="NAME"></a>
</h2>
<p style="margin-left:9%; margin-top: 1em">perlxstypemap
− Perl XS C/Perl type mapping</p>
<h2>DESCRIPTION
<a name="DESCRIPTION"></a>
</h2>
<p style="margin-left:9%; margin-top: 1em">The more you
think about interfacing between two languages, the more
you'll realize that the majority of programmer effort has to
go into converting between the data structures that are
native to either of the languages involved. This trumps
other matter such as differing calling conventions because
the problem space is so much greater. There are simply more
ways to shove data into memory than there are ways to
implement a function call.</p>
<p style="margin-left:9%; margin-top: 1em">Perl XS' attempt
at a solution to this is the concept of typemaps. At an
abstract level, a Perl XS typemap is nothing but a recipe
for converting from a certain Perl data structure to a
certain C data structure and vice versa. Since there can be
C types that are sufficiently similar to one another to
warrant converting with the same logic, XS typemaps are
represented by a unique identifier, henceforth called an
<b>XS type</b> in this document. You can then tell the XS
compiler that multiple C types are to be mapped with the
same XS typemap.</p>
<p style="margin-left:9%; margin-top: 1em">In your XS code,
when you define an argument with a C type or when you are
using a "CODE:" and an "OUTPUT:" section
together with a C return type of your XSUB, it'll be the
typemapping mechanism that makes this easy.</p>
<h3>Anatomy of a typemap
<a name="Anatomy of a typemap"></a>
</h3>
<p style="margin-left:9%; margin-top: 1em">In more
practical terms, the typemap is a collection of code
fragments which are used by the <b>xsubpp</b> compiler to
map C function parameters and values to Perl values. The
typemap file may consist of three sections labelled
"TYPEMAP", "INPUT", and
"OUTPUT". An unlabelled initial section is assumed
to be a "TYPEMAP" section. The INPUT section tells
the compiler how to translate Perl values into variables of
certain C types. The OUTPUT section tells the compiler how
to translate the values from certain C types into values
Perl can understand. The TYPEMAP section tells the compiler
which of the INPUT and OUTPUT code fragments should be used
to map a given C type to a Perl value. The section labels
"TYPEMAP", "INPUT", or
"OUTPUT" must begin in the first column on a line
by themselves, and must be in uppercase.</p>
<p style="margin-left:9%; margin-top: 1em">Each type of
section can appear an arbitrary number of times and does not
have to appear at all. For example, a typemap may commonly
lack "INPUT" and "OUTPUT" sections if
all it needs to do is associate additional C types with core
XS types like T_PTROBJ. Lines that start with a hash
"#" are considered comments and ignored in the
"TYPEMAP" section, but are considered significant
in "INPUT" and "OUTPUT". Blank lines are
generally ignored.</p>
<p style="margin-left:9%; margin-top: 1em">Traditionally,
typemaps needed to be written to a separate file,
conventionally called "typemap" in a CPAN
distribution. With ExtUtils::ParseXS (the XS compiler)
version 3.12 or better which comes with perl 5.16, typemaps
can also be embedded directly into XS code using a
HERE−doc like syntax:</p>
<p style="margin-left:9%; margin-top: 1em">TYPEMAP:
&lt;&lt;HERE <br/>
... <br/>
HERE</p>
<p style="margin-left:9%; margin-top: 1em">where
"HERE" can be replaced by other identifiers like
with normal Perl HERE−docs. All details below about
the typemap textual format remain valid.</p>
<p style="margin-left:9%; margin-top: 1em">The
"TYPEMAP" section should contain one pair of C
type and XS type per line as follows. An example from the
core typemap file:</p>
<p style="margin-left:9%; margin-top: 1em">TYPEMAP <br/>
# all variants of char* is handled by the T_PV typemap <br/>
char * T_PV <br/>
const char * T_PV <br/>
unsigned char * T_PV <br/>
...</p>
<p style="margin-left:9%; margin-top: 1em">The
"INPUT" and "OUTPUT" sections have
identical formats, that is, each unindented line starts a
new in− or output map respectively. A new in− or
output map must start with the name of the XS type to map on
a line by itself, followed by the code that implements it
indented on the following lines. Example:</p>
<p style="margin-left:9%; margin-top: 1em">INPUT <br/>
T_PV <br/>
$var = ($type)SvPV_nolen($arg) <br/>
T_PTR <br/>
$var = INT2PTR($type,SvIV($arg))</p>
<p style="margin-left:9%; margin-top: 1em">We'll get to the
meaning of those Perlish−looking variables in a little
bit.</p>
<p style="margin-left:9%; margin-top: 1em">Finally, here's
an example of the full typemap file for mapping C strings of
the "char *" type to Perl scalars/strings:</p>
<p style="margin-left:9%; margin-top: 1em">TYPEMAP <br/>
char * T_PV <br/>
INPUT <br/>
T_PV <br/>
$var = ($type)SvPV_nolen($arg) <br/>
OUTPUT <br/>
T_PV <br/>
sv_setpv((SV*)$arg, $var);</p>
<p style="margin-left:9%; margin-top: 1em">Here's a more
complicated example: suppose that you wanted "struct
netconfig" to be blessed into the class
"Net::Config". One way to do this is to use
underscores (_) to separate package names, as follows:</p>
<p style="margin-left:9%; margin-top: 1em">typedef struct
netconfig * Net_Config;</p>
<p style="margin-left:9%; margin-top: 1em">And then provide
a typemap entry "T_PTROBJ_SPECIAL" that maps
underscores to double−colons (::), and declare
"Net_Config" to be of that type:</p>
<p style="margin-left:9%; margin-top: 1em">TYPEMAP <br/>
Net_Config T_PTROBJ_SPECIAL <br/>
INPUT <br/>
T_PTROBJ_SPECIAL <br/>
if (sv_derived_from($arg, \"${(my
$ntt=$ntype)=˜s/_/::/g;\$ntt}\")){ <br/>
IV tmp = SvIV((SV*)SvRV($arg)); <br/>
$var = INT2PTR($type, tmp); <br/>
} <br/>
else <br/>
croak(\"$var is not of type ${(my
$ntt=$ntype)=˜s/_/::/g;\$ntt}\") <br/>
OUTPUT <br/>
T_PTROBJ_SPECIAL <br/>
sv_setref_pv($arg, \"${(my
$ntt=$ntype)=˜s/_/::/g;\$ntt}\", <br/>
(void*)$var);</p>
<p style="margin-left:9%; margin-top: 1em">The INPUT and
OUTPUT sections substitute underscores for
double−colons on the fly, giving the desired effect.
This example demonstrates some of the power and versatility
of the typemap facility.</p>
<p style="margin-left:9%; margin-top: 1em">The
"INT2PTR" macro (defined in perl.h) casts an
integer to a pointer of a given type, taking care of the
possible different size of integers and pointers. There are
also "PTR2IV", "PTR2UV",
"PTR2NV" macros, to map the other way, which may
be useful in OUTPUT sections.</p>
<h3>The Role of the typemap File in Your Distribution
<a name="The Role of the typemap File in Your Distribution"></a>
</h3>
<p style="margin-left:9%; margin-top: 1em">The default
typemap in the <i>lib/ExtUtils</i> directory of the Perl
source contains many useful types which can be used by Perl
extensions. Some extensions define additional typemaps which
they keep in their own directory. These additional typemaps
may reference INPUT and OUTPUT maps in the main typemap. The
<b>xsubpp</b> compiler will allow the extension's own
typemap to override any mappings which are in the default
typemap. Instead of using an additional <i>typemap</i> file,
typemaps may be embedded verbatim in XS with a
heredoc−like syntax. See the documentation on the
"TYPEMAP:" XS keyword.</p>
<p style="margin-left:9%; margin-top: 1em">For CPAN
distributions, you can assume that the XS types defined by
the perl core are already available. Additionally, the core
typemap has default XS types for a large number of C types.
For example, if you simply return a "char *" from
your XSUB, the core typemap will have this C type associated
with the T_PV XS type. That means your C string will be
copied into the PV (pointer value) slot of a new scalar that
will be returned from your XSUB to Perl.</p>
<p style="margin-left:9%; margin-top: 1em">If you're
developing a CPAN distribution using XS, you may add your
own file called <i>typemap</i> to the distribution. That
file may contain typemaps that either map types that are
specific to your code or that override the core typemap
file's mappings for common C types.</p>
<h3>Sharing typemaps Between CPAN Distributions
<a name="Sharing typemaps Between CPAN Distributions"></a>
</h3>
<p style="margin-left:9%; margin-top: 1em">Starting with
ExtUtils::ParseXS version 3.13_01 (comes with perl 5.16 and
better), it is rather easy to share typemap code between
multiple CPAN distributions. The general idea is to share it
as a module that offers a certain API and have the dependent
modules declare that as a built−time requirement and
import the typemap into the XS. An example of such a
typemap−sharing module on CPAN is
"ExtUtils::Typemaps::Basic". Two steps to getting
that module's typemaps available in your code:</p>
<table border="0" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" frame="void" rules="none" width="100%">
<tr align="left" valign="top">
<td width="9%"></td>
<td width="1%">
<p>•</p></td>
<td width="4%"></td>
<td width="83%">
<p>Declare "ExtUtils::Typemaps::Basic" as a
build−time dependency in "Makefile.PL" (use
"BUILD_REQUIRES"), or in your "Build.PL"
(use "build_requires").</p></td>
<td width="3%">
</td></tr>
<tr align="left" valign="top">
<td width="9%"></td>
<td width="1%">
<p>•</p></td>
<td width="4%"></td>
<td width="83%">
<p>Include the following line in the XS section of your XS
file: (don't break the line)</p></td>
<td width="3%">
</td></tr>
</table>
<p style="margin-left:14%; margin-top: 1em">INCLUDE_COMMAND:
$ˆX −MExtUtils::Typemaps::Cmd <br/>
−e "print embeddable_typemap(q{Basic})"</p>
<h3>Writing typemap Entries
<a name="Writing typemap Entries"></a>
</h3>
<p style="margin-left:9%; margin-top: 1em">Each INPUT or
OUTPUT typemap entry is a double−quoted Perl string
that will be evaluated in the presence of certain variables
to get the final C code for mapping a certain C type.</p>
<p style="margin-left:9%; margin-top: 1em">This means that
you can embed Perl code in your typemap (C) code using
constructs such as "${ perl code that evaluates to
scalar reference here }". A common use case is to
generate error messages that refer to the true function name
even when using the ALIAS XS feature:</p>
<p style="margin-left:9%; margin-top: 1em">${ $ALIAS ?
\q[GvNAME(CvGV(cv))] : \qq[\"$pname\"] }</p>
<p style="margin-left:9%; margin-top: 1em">For many typemap
examples, refer to the core typemap file that can be found
in the perl source tree at <i>lib/ExtUtils/typemap</i>.</p>
<p style="margin-left:9%; margin-top: 1em">The Perl
variables that are available for interpolation into typemaps
are the following:</p>
<table border="0" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" frame="void" rules="none" width="100%">

values.</p> </td></tr>

<h3>Full Listing of Core Typemaps
<a name="Full Listing of Core Typemaps"></a>
</h3>
<p style="margin-left:9%; margin-top: 1em">Each C type is
represented by an entry in the typemap file that is
responsible for converting perl variables (SV, AV, HV, CV,
etc.) to and from that type. The following sections list all
XS types that come with perl by default. <br/>
T_SV</p>
<p style="margin-left:14%;">This simply passes the C
representation of the Perl variable (an SV*) in and out of
the XS layer. This can be used if the C code wants to deal
directly with the Perl variable.</p>
<p style="margin-left:9%;">T_SVREF</p>
<p style="margin-left:14%;">Used to pass in and return a
reference to an SV.</p>
<p style="margin-left:14%; margin-top: 1em">Note that this
typemap does not decrement the reference count when
returning the reference to an SV*. See also:
T_SVREF_REFCOUNT_FIXED</p>
<p style="margin-left:9%;">T_SVREF_FIXED</p>
<p style="margin-left:14%;">Used to pass in and return a
reference to an SV. This is a fixed variant of T_SVREF that
decrements the refcount appropriately when returning a
reference to an SV*. Introduced in perl 5.15.4.</p>
<p style="margin-left:9%;">T_AVREF</p>
<p style="margin-left:14%;">From the perl level this is a
reference to a perl array. From the C level this is a
pointer to an AV.</p>
<p style="margin-left:14%; margin-top: 1em">Note that this
typemap does not decrement the reference count when
returning an AV*. See also: T_AVREF_REFCOUNT_FIXED</p>
<p style="margin-left:9%;">T_AVREF_REFCOUNT_FIXED</p>
<p style="margin-left:14%;">From the perl level this is a
reference to a perl array. From the C level this is a
pointer to an AV. This is a fixed variant of T_AVREF that
decrements the refcount appropriately when returning an AV*.
Introduced in perl 5.15.4.</p>
<p style="margin-left:9%;">T_HVREF</p>
<p style="margin-left:14%;">From the perl level this is a
reference to a perl hash. From the C level this is a pointer
to an HV.</p>
<p style="margin-left:14%; margin-top: 1em">Note that this
typemap does not decrement the reference count when
returning an HV*. See also: T_HVREF_REFCOUNT_FIXED</p>
<p style="margin-left:9%;">T_HVREF_REFCOUNT_FIXED</p>
<p style="margin-left:14%;">From the perl level this is a
reference to a perl hash. From the C level this is a pointer
to an HV. This is a fixed variant of T_HVREF that decrements
the refcount appropriately when returning an HV*. Introduced
in perl 5.15.4.</p>
<p style="margin-left:9%;">T_CVREF</p>
<p style="margin-left:14%;">From the perl level this is a
reference to a perl subroutine (e.g. $sub = sub { 1 };).
From the C level this is a pointer to a CV.</p>
<p style="margin-left:14%; margin-top: 1em">Note that this
typemap does not decrement the reference count when
returning an HV*. See also: T_HVREF_REFCOUNT_FIXED</p>
<p style="margin-left:9%;">T_CVREF_REFCOUNT_FIXED</p>
<p style="margin-left:14%;">From the perl level this is a
reference to a perl subroutine (e.g. $sub = sub { 1 };).
From the C level this is a pointer to a CV.</p>
<p style="margin-left:14%; margin-top: 1em">This is a fixed
variant of T_HVREF that decrements the refcount
appropriately when returning an HV*. Introduced in perl
5.15.4.</p>
<p style="margin-left:9%;">T_SYSRET</p>
<p style="margin-left:14%;">The T_SYSRET typemap is used to
process return values from system calls. It is only
meaningful when passing values from C to perl (there is no
concept of passing a system return value from Perl to
C).</p>
<p style="margin-left:14%; margin-top: 1em">System calls
return −1 on error (setting ERRNO with the reason) and
(usually) 0 on success. If the return value is −1 this
typemap returns "undef". If the return value is
not −1, this typemap translates a 0 (perl false) to
"0 but true" (which is perl true) or returns the
value itself, to indicate that the command succeeded.</p>
<p style="margin-left:14%; margin-top: 1em">The POSIX
module makes extensive use of this type.</p>
<p style="margin-left:9%;">T_UV</p>
<p style="margin-left:14%;">An unsigned integer.</p>
<p style="margin-left:9%;">T_IV</p>
<p style="margin-left:14%;">A signed integer. This is cast
to the required integer type when passed to C and converted
to an IV when passed back to Perl.</p>
<p style="margin-left:9%;">T_INT</p>
<p style="margin-left:14%;">A signed integer. This typemap
converts the Perl value to a native integer type (the
"int" type on the current platform). When
returning the value to perl it is processed in the same way
as for T_IV.</p>
<p style="margin-left:14%; margin-top: 1em">Its behaviour
is identical to using an "int" type in XS with
T_IV.</p>
<p style="margin-left:9%;">T_ENUM</p>
<p style="margin-left:14%;">An enum value. Used to transfer
an enum component from C. There is no reason to pass an enum
value to C since it is stored as an IV inside perl.</p>
<p style="margin-left:9%;">T_BOOL</p>
<p style="margin-left:14%;">A boolean type. This can be
used to pass true and false values to and from C.</p>
<p style="margin-left:9%;">T_U_INT</p>
<p style="margin-left:14%;">This is for unsigned integers.
It is equivalent to using T_UV but explicitly casts the
variable to type "unsigned int". The default type
for "unsigned int" is T_UV.</p>
<p style="margin-left:9%;">T_SHORT</p>
<p style="margin-left:14%;">Short integers. This is
equivalent to T_IV but explicitly casts the return to type
"short". The default typemap for "short"
is T_IV.</p>
<p style="margin-left:9%;">T_U_SHORT</p>
<p style="margin-left:14%;">Unsigned short integers. This
is equivalent to T_UV but explicitly casts the return to
type "unsigned short". The default typemap for
"unsigned short" is T_UV.</p>
<p style="margin-left:14%; margin-top: 1em">T_U_SHORT is
used for type "U16" in the standard typemap.</p>
<p style="margin-left:9%;">T_LONG</p>
<p style="margin-left:14%;">Long integers. This is
equivalent to T_IV but explicitly casts the return to type
"long". The default typemap for "long"
is T_IV.</p>
<p style="margin-left:9%;">T_U_LONG</p>
<p style="margin-left:14%;">Unsigned long integers. This is
equivalent to T_UV but explicitly casts the return to type
"unsigned long". The default typemap for
"unsigned long" is T_UV.</p>
<p style="margin-left:14%; margin-top: 1em">T_U_LONG is
used for type "U32" in the standard typemap.</p>
<p style="margin-left:9%;">T_CHAR</p>
<p style="margin-left:14%;">Single 8−bit
characters.</p>
<p style="margin-left:9%;">T_U_CHAR</p>
<p style="margin-left:14%;">An unsigned byte.</p>
<p style="margin-left:9%;">T_FLOAT</p>
<p style="margin-left:14%;">A floating point number. This
typemap guarantees to return a variable cast to a
"float".</p>
<p style="margin-left:9%;">T_NV</p>
<p style="margin-left:14%;">A Perl floating point number.
Similar to T_IV and T_UV in that the return type is cast to
the requested numeric type rather than to a specific
type.</p>
<p style="margin-left:9%;">T_DOUBLE</p>
<p style="margin-left:14%;">A double precision floating
point number. This typemap guarantees to return a variable
cast to a "double".</p>
<p style="margin-left:9%;">T_PV</p>
<p style="margin-left:14%;">A string (char *).</p>
<p style="margin-left:9%;">T_PTR</p>
<p style="margin-left:14%;">A memory address (pointer).
Typically associated with a "void *" type.</p>
<p style="margin-left:9%;">T_PTRREF</p>
<p style="margin-left:14%;">Similar to T_PTR except that
the pointer is stored in a scalar and the reference to that
scalar is returned to the caller. This can be used to hide
the actual pointer value from the programmer since it is
usually not required directly from within perl.</p>
<p style="margin-left:14%; margin-top: 1em">The typemap
checks that a scalar reference is passed from perl to
XS.</p>
<p style="margin-left:9%;">T_PTROBJ</p>
<p style="margin-left:14%;">Similar to T_PTRREF except that
the reference is blessed into a class. This allows the
pointer to be used as an object. Most commonly used to deal
with C structs. The typemap checks that the perl object
passed into the XS routine is of the correct class (or part
of a subclass).</p>
<p style="margin-left:14%; margin-top: 1em">The pointer is
blessed into a class that is derived from the name of type
of the pointer but with all '*' in the name replaced with
'Ptr'.</p>
<p style="margin-left:14%; margin-top: 1em">For
"DESTROY" XSUBs only, a T_PTROBJ is optimized to a
T_PTRREF. This means the class check is skipped.</p>
<p style="margin-left:9%;">T_REF_IV_REF</p>
<p style="margin-left:14%;">NOT YET</p>
<p style="margin-left:9%;">T_REF_IV_PTR</p>
<p style="margin-left:14%;">Similar to T_PTROBJ in that the
pointer is blessed into a scalar object. The difference is
that when the object is passed back into XS it must be of
the correct type (inheritance is not supported) while
T_PTROBJ supports inheritance.</p>
<p style="margin-left:14%; margin-top: 1em">The pointer is
blessed into a class that is derived from the name of type
of the pointer but with all '*' in the name replaced with
'Ptr'.</p>
<p style="margin-left:14%; margin-top: 1em">For
"DESTROY" XSUBs only, a T_REF_IV_PTR is optimized
to a T_PTRREF. This means the class check is skipped.</p>
<p style="margin-left:9%;">T_PTRDESC</p>
<p style="margin-left:14%;">NOT YET</p>
<p style="margin-left:9%;">T_REFREF</p>
<p style="margin-left:14%;">Similar to T_PTRREF, except the
pointer stored in the referenced scalar is dereferenced and
copied to the output variable. This means that T_REFREF is
to T_PTRREF as T_OPAQUE is to T_OPAQUEPTR. All clear?</p>
<p style="margin-left:14%; margin-top: 1em">Only the INPUT
part of this is implemented (Perl to XSUB) and there are no
known users in core or on CPAN.</p>
<p style="margin-left:9%;">T_REFOBJ</p>
<p style="margin-left:14%;">Like T_REFREF, except it does
strict type checking (inheritance is not supported).</p>
<p style="margin-left:14%; margin-top: 1em">For
"DESTROY" XSUBs only, a T_REFOBJ is optimized to a
T_REFREF. This means the class check is skipped.</p>
<p style="margin-left:9%;">T_OPAQUEPTR</p>
<p style="margin-left:14%;">This can be used to store bytes
in the string component of the SV. Here the representation
of the data is irrelevant to perl and the bytes themselves
are just stored in the SV. It is assumed that the C variable
is a pointer (the bytes are copied from that memory
location). If the pointer is pointing to something that is
represented by 8 bytes then those 8 bytes are stored in the
SV (and <b>length()</b> will report a value of 8). This
entry is similar to T_OPAQUE.</p>
<p style="margin-left:14%; margin-top: 1em">In principle
the <b>unpack()</b> command can be used to convert the bytes
back to a number (if the underlying type is known to be a
number).</p>
<p style="margin-left:14%; margin-top: 1em">This entry can
be used to store a C structure (the number of bytes to be
copied is calculated using the C "sizeof"
function) and can be used as an alternative to T_PTRREF
without having to worry about a memory leak (since Perl will
clean up the SV).</p>
<p style="margin-left:9%;">T_OPAQUE</p>
<p style="margin-left:14%;">This can be used to store data
from non−pointer types in the string part of an SV. It
is similar to T_OPAQUEPTR except that the typemap retrieves
the pointer directly rather than assuming it is being
supplied. For example, if an integer is imported into Perl
using T_OPAQUE rather than T_IV the underlying bytes
representing the integer will be stored in the SV but the
actual integer value will not be available. i.e. The data is
opaque to perl.</p>
<p style="margin-left:14%; margin-top: 1em">The data may be
retrieved using the "unpack" function if the
underlying type of the byte stream is known.</p>
<p style="margin-left:14%; margin-top: 1em">T_OPAQUE
supports input and output of simple types. T_OPAQUEPTR can
be used to pass these bytes back into C if a pointer is
acceptable.</p>
<p style="margin-left:9%;">Implicit array</p>
<p style="margin-left:14%;">xsubpp supports a special
syntax for returning packed C arrays to perl. If the XS
return type is given as</p>
<p style="margin-left:14%; margin-top: 1em">array(type,
nelem)</p>
<p style="margin-left:14%; margin-top: 1em">xsubpp will
copy the contents of "nelem * sizeof(type)" bytes
from RETVAL to an SV and push it onto the stack. This is
only really useful if the number of items to be returned is
known at compile time and you don't mind having a string of
bytes in your SV. Use T_ARRAY to push a variable number of
arguments onto the return stack (they won't be packed as a
single string though).</p>
<p style="margin-left:14%; margin-top: 1em">This is similar
to using T_OPAQUEPTR but can be used to process more than
one element.</p>
<p style="margin-left:9%;">T_PACKED</p>
<p style="margin-left:14%;">Calls user−supplied
functions for conversion. For "OUTPUT" (XSUB to
Perl), a function named "XS_pack_$ntype" is called
with the output Perl scalar and the C variable to convert
from. $ntype is the normalized C type that is to be mapped
to Perl. Normalized means that all "*" are
replaced by the string "Ptr". The return value of
the function is ignored.</p>
<p style="margin-left:14%; margin-top: 1em">Conversely for
"INPUT" (Perl to XSUB) mapping, the function named
"XS_unpack_$ntype" is called with the input Perl
scalar as argument and the return value is cast to the
mapped C type and assigned to the output C variable.</p>
<p style="margin-left:14%; margin-top: 1em">An example
conversion function for a typemapped struct "foo_t
*" might be:</p>
<p style="margin-left:14%; margin-top: 1em">static void
<br/>
XS_pack_foo_tPtr(SV *out, foo_t *in) <br/>
{ <br/>
dTHX; /* alas, signature does not include pTHX_ */ <br/>
HV* hash = newHV(); <br/>
hv_stores(hash, "int_member",
newSViv(in−&gt;int_member)); <br/>
hv_stores(hash, "float_member",
newSVnv(in−&gt;float_member)); <br/>
/* ... */ <br/>
/* mortalize as thy stack is not refcounted */ <br/>
sv_setsv(out, sv_2mortal(newRV_noinc((SV*)hash))); <br/>
}</p>
<p style="margin-left:14%; margin-top: 1em">The conversion
from Perl to C is left as an exercise to the reader, but the
prototype would be:</p>
<p style="margin-left:14%; margin-top: 1em">static foo_t *
<br/>
XS_unpack_foo_tPtr(SV *in);</p>
<p style="margin-left:14%; margin-top: 1em">Instead of an
actual C function that has to fetch the thread context using
"dTHX", you can define macros of the same name and
avoid the overhead. Also, keep in mind to possibly free the
memory allocated by "XS_unpack_foo_tPtr".</p>
<p style="margin-left:9%;">T_PACKEDARRAY</p>
<p style="margin-left:14%;">T_PACKEDARRAY is similar to
T_PACKED. In fact, the "INPUT" (Perl to XSUB)
typemap is identical, but the "OUTPUT" typemap
passes an additional argument to the
"XS_pack_$ntype" function. This third parameter
indicates the number of elements in the output so that the
function can handle C arrays sanely. The variable needs to
be declared by the user and must have the name
"count_$ntype" where $ntype is the normalized C
type name as explained above. The signature of the function
would be for the example above and "foo_t **":</p>
<p style="margin-left:14%; margin-top: 1em">static void
<br/>
XS_pack_foo_tPtrPtr(SV *out, foo_t *in, UV
count_foo_tPtrPtr);</p>
<p style="margin-left:14%; margin-top: 1em">The type of the
third parameter is arbitrary as far as the typemap is
concerned. It just has to be in line with the declared
variable.</p>
<p style="margin-left:14%; margin-top: 1em">Of course,
unless you know the number of elements in the "sometype
**" C array, within your XSUB, the return value from
"foo_t ** XS_unpack_foo_tPtrPtr(...)" will be hard
to decipher. Since the details are all up to the XS author
(the typemap user), there are several solutions, none of
which particularly elegant. The most commonly seen solution
has been to allocate memory for N+1 pointers and assign
"NULL" to the (N+1)th to facilitate iteration.</p>
<p style="margin-left:14%; margin-top: 1em">Alternatively,
using a customized typemap for your purposes in the first
place is probably preferable.</p>
<p style="margin-left:9%;">T_DATAUNIT</p>
<p style="margin-left:14%;">NOT YET</p>
<p style="margin-left:9%;">T_CALLBACK</p>
<p style="margin-left:14%;">NOT YET</p>
<p style="margin-left:9%;">T_ARRAY</p>
<p style="margin-left:14%;">This is used to convert the
perl argument list to a C array and for pushing the contents
of a C array onto the perl argument stack.</p>
<p style="margin-left:14%; margin-top: 1em">The usual
calling signature is</p>
<p style="margin-left:14%; margin-top: 1em">@out =
array_func( @in );</p>
<p style="margin-left:14%; margin-top: 1em">Any number of
arguments can occur in the list before the array but the
input and output arrays must be the last elements in the
list.</p>
<p style="margin-left:14%; margin-top: 1em">When used to
pass a perl list to C the XS writer must provide a function
(named after the array type but with 'Ptr' substituted for
'*') to allocate the memory required to hold the list. A
pointer should be returned. It is up to the XS writer to
free the memory on exit from the function. The variable
"ix_$var" is set to the number of elements in the
new array.</p>
<p style="margin-left:14%; margin-top: 1em">When returning
a C array to Perl the XS writer must provide an integer
variable called "size_$var" containing the number
of elements in the array. This is used to determine how many
elements should be pushed onto the return argument stack.
This is not required on input since Perl knows how many
arguments are on the stack when the routine is called.
Ordinarily this variable would be called
"size_RETVAL".</p>
<p style="margin-left:14%; margin-top: 1em">Additionally,
the type of each element is determined from the type of the
array. If the array uses type "intArray *" xsubpp
will automatically work out that it contains variables of
type "int" and use that typemap entry to perform
the copy of each element. All pointer '*' and 'Array' tags
are removed from the name to determine the subtype.</p>
<p style="margin-left:9%;">T_STDIO</p>
<p style="margin-left:14%;">This is used for passing perl
filehandles to and from C using "FILE *"
structures.</p>
<p style="margin-left:9%;">T_INOUT</p>
<p style="margin-left:14%;">This is used for passing perl
filehandles to and from C using "PerlIO *"
structures. The file handle can used for reading and
writing. This corresponds to the "+&lt;" mode, see
also T_IN and T_OUT.</p>
<p style="margin-left:14%; margin-top: 1em">See perliol for
more information on the Perl IO abstraction layer. Perl must
have been built with "−Duseperlio".</p>
<p style="margin-left:14%; margin-top: 1em">There is no
check to assert that the filehandle passed from Perl to C
was created with the right open() mode.</p>
<p style="margin-left:14%; margin-top: 1em">Hint: The
perlxstut tutorial covers the T_INOUT, T_IN, and T_OUT XS
types nicely.</p>
<p style="margin-left:9%;">T_IN</p>
<p style="margin-left:14%;">Same as T_INOUT, but the
filehandle that is returned from C to Perl can only be used
for reading (mode "&lt;").</p>
<p style="margin-left:9%;">T_OUT</p>
<p style="margin-left:14%;">Same as T_INOUT, but the
filehandle that is returned from C to Perl is set to use the
open mode "+&gt;".</p>
