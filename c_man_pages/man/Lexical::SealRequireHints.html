<h2>NAME

<p style="margin-left:9%; margin-top: 1em">Lexical::SealRequireHints
− prevent leakage of lexical hints</p>
<h2>SYNOPSIS
<a name="SYNOPSIS"></a>
</h2>
<p style="margin-left:9%; margin-top: 1em">use
Lexical::SealRequireHints;</p>
<h2>DESCRIPTION
<a name="DESCRIPTION"></a>
</h2>
<p style="margin-left:9%; margin-top: 1em">This module
works around two historical bugs in Perl's handling of the
"%ˆH" (lexical hints) variable. One bug
causes lexical state in one file to leak into another that
is "require"d/"use"d/"do"ed
from it. This bug, [perl #68590], was present from Perl 5.6
up to Perl 5.10, fixed in Perl 5.11.0. The second bug causes
lexical state (normally a blank "%ˆH" once
the first bug is fixed) to leak outwards from
"utf8.pm", if it is automatically loaded during
Unicode regular expression matching, into whatever source is
compiling at the time of the regexp match. This bug, [perl
#73174], was present from Perl 5.8.7 up to Perl 5.11.5,
fixed in Perl 5.12.0.</p>
<p style="margin-left:9%; margin-top: 1em">Both of these
bugs seriously damage the usability of any module relying on
"%ˆH" for lexical scoping, on the affected
Perl versions. It is in practice essential to work around
these bugs when using such modules. On versions of Perl that
require such a workaround, this module globally changes the
behaviour of "require", including "use"
and the implicit "require" performed in Unicode
regular expression matching, and of "do", so that
they no longer exhibit these bugs.</p>
<p style="margin-left:9%; margin-top: 1em">The workaround
supplied by this module takes effect the first time its
"import" method is called. Typically this will be
done by means of a "use" statement. This should be
done as early as possible, because it only affects
"require"/"use"/"do"
statements that are compiled after the workaround goes into
effect. For "use" statements, and
"require" and "do" statements that are
executed immediately and only once, it suffices to invoke
the workaround when loading the first module that will set
up vulnerable lexical state. Delayed−action
"require" and "do" statements, however,
are more troublesome, and can require the workaround to be
loaded much earlier. Ultimately, an affected Perl program
may need to load the workaround as very nearly its first
action. Invoking this module multiple times, from multiple
modules, is not a problem: the workaround is only applied
once, and applies to everything subsequently compiled.</p>
<p style="margin-left:9%; margin-top: 1em">This module is
implemented in XS, with a pure Perl backup version for
systems that can't handle XS modules. The XS version has a
better chance of playing nicely with other modules that
modify "require" or "do" handling. The
pure Perl version can't work at all on some Perl versions;
users of those versions must use the XS. On all Perl
versions suffering the underlying hint leakage bug, pure
Perl hooking of "require" breaks the use of
"require" without an explicit parameter
(implicitly using $_).</p>
<h2>PERL VERSION DIFFERENCES
<a name="PERL VERSION DIFFERENCES"></a>
</h2>
<p style="margin-left:9%; margin-top: 1em">The history of
the "%ˆH" bugs is complex. Here is a
chronological statement of the relevant changes. <br/>
Perl 5.6.0</p>
<p style="margin-left:14%;">"%ˆH"
introduced. It exists only as a hash at compile time. It is
not localised by "require"/"do", so
lexical hints leak into every module loaded, which is bug
[perl #68590].</p>
<p style="margin-left:14%; margin-top: 1em">The
"CORE::GLOBAL" mechanism doesn't work cleanly for
"require", because overriding "require"
loses the necessary special parsing of bareword arguments to
it. As a result, pure Perl code can't properly globally
affect the behaviour of "require". Pure Perl code
can localise "%ˆH" itself for any particular
"require" invocation, but a global fix is only
possible through XS.</p>
<p style="margin-left:9%;">Perl 5.7.2</p>
<p style="margin-left:14%;">The "CORE::GLOBAL"
mechanism now works cleanly for "require", so pure
Perl code can globally affect the behaviour of
"require" to achieve a global fix for the bug.</p>
<p style="margin-left:9%;">Perl 5.8.7</p>
<p style="margin-left:14%;">When "utf8.pm" is
automatically loaded during Unicode regular expression
matching, "%ˆH" now leaks outward from it
into whatever source is compiling at the time of the regexp
match, which is bug [perl #73174]. It often goes unnoticed,
because [perl #68590] makes "%ˆH" leak into
"utf8.pm" which then doesn't modify it, so what
leaks out tends to be identical to what leaked in. If [perl
#68590] is worked around, however, "%ˆH"
tends to be (correctly) blank inside "utf8.pm",
and this bug therefore blanks it for the outer module.</p>
<p style="margin-left:9%;">Perl 5.9.4</p>
<p style="margin-left:14%;">"%ˆH" now exists
in two forms. In addition to the relatively ordinary hash
that is modified during compilation, the value that it had
at each point in compilation is recorded in the compiled op
tree, for later examination at runtime. It is in a special
representation−sharing format, and writes to
"%ˆH" are meant to be performed on both
forms. "require"/"do" does not localise
the runtime form of "%ˆH" (and still doesn't
localise the compile−time form).</p>
<p style="margin-left:14%; margin-top: 1em">A couple of
special "%ˆH" entries are erroneously written
only to the runtime form.</p>
<p style="margin-left:14%; margin-top: 1em">Pure Perl code,
although it can localise the compile−time
"%ˆH" by normal means, can't adequately
localise the runtime "%ˆH", except by using a
string eval stack frame. This makes a satisfactory global
fix for the leakage bug impossible in pure Perl.</p>
<p style="margin-left:9%;">Perl 5.10.1</p>
<p style="margin-left:14%;">"require"/"do"
now properly localise the runtime form of
"%ˆH", but still not the compile−time
form.</p>
<p style="margin-left:14%; margin-top: 1em">A global fix is
once again possible in pure Perl, because the fix only needs
to localise the compile−time form.</p>
<p style="margin-left:9%;">Perl 5.11.0</p>
<p style="margin-left:14%;">"require"/"do"
now properly localise both forms of "%ˆH",
fixing [perl #68590]. This makes [perl #73174] apparent
without any workaround for [perl #68590].</p>
<p style="margin-left:14%; margin-top: 1em">The special
"%ˆH" entries are now correctly written to
both forms of the hash.</p>
<p style="margin-left:9%;">Perl 5.12.0</p>
<p style="margin-left:14%;">The automatic loading of
"utf8.pm" during Unicode regular expression
matching now properly restores "%ˆH", fixing
[perl #73174].</p>
<h2>BUGS
<a name="BUGS"></a>
</h2>
<p style="margin-left:9%; margin-top: 1em">The operation of
this module depends on influencing the compilation of
"require" and "do". As a result, it
cannot prevent lexical state leakage through a
"require"/"do" statement that was
compiled before this module was invoked. Where problems
occur, this module must be invoked earlier.</p>
<p style="margin-left:9%; margin-top: 1em">On all Perl
versions that need a fix for the lexical hint leakage bug,
the pure Perl implementation of this module unavoidably
breaks the use of "require" without an explicit
parameter (implicitly using $_). This is due to another bug
in the Perl core, fixed in Perl 5.15.5, and is inherent to
the mechanism by which pure Perl code can hook
"require". The use of implicit $_ with
"require" is rare, so although this state of
affairs is faulty it will actually work for most programs.
Perl versions 5.12.0 and greater, despite having the
"require" hooking bug, don't actually exhibit a
problem with the pure Perl version of this module, because
with the lexical hint leakage bug fixed there is no need for
this module to hook "require".</p>
<p style="margin-left:9%; margin-top: 1em">There is a bug
on Perl versions 5.15.5 to 5.15.7 affecting "do"
which, among other effects, causes "%ˆH" to
leak into "do"ed files. It is not the same bug
that affected Perl 5.6 to 5.11. This module currently does
not work around this bug at all, but its test suite does
detect it. As a result, this module fails its test suite on
those Perl versions. This could change in future versions of
this module.</p>
