<p style="margin-left:9%; margin-top: 1em">Pod::Man −
Convert POD data to formatted *roff input</p>
<h2>SYNOPSIS
<a name="SYNOPSIS"></a>
</h2>
<p style="margin-left:9%; margin-top: 1em">use Pod::Man;
<br/>
my $parser = Pod::Man−&gt;new (release =&gt; $VERSION,
section =&gt; 8); <br/>
# Read POD from STDIN and write to STDOUT. <br/>
$parser−&gt;parse_file (\*STDIN); <br/>
# Read POD from file.pod and write to file.1. <br/>
$parser−&gt;parse_from_file ('file.pod',
'file.1');</p>
<h2>DESCRIPTION
<a name="DESCRIPTION"></a>
</h2>
<p style="margin-left:9%; margin-top: 1em">Pod::Man is a
module to convert documentation in the POD format (the
preferred language for documenting Perl) into *roff input
using the man macro set. The resulting *roff code is
suitable for display on a terminal using <b>nroff</b>(1),
normally via <b>man</b>(1), or printing using
<b>troff</b>(1). It is conventionally invoked using the
driver script <b>pod2man</b>, but it can also be used
directly.</p>
<p style="margin-left:9%; margin-top: 1em">By default (on
non−EBCDIC systems), Pod::Man outputs UTF−8. Its
output should work with the <b>man</b> program on systems
that use <b>groff</b> (most Linux distributions) or
<b>mandoc</b> (most BSD variants), but may result in mangled
output on older UNIX systems. To choose a different,
possibly more backward−compatible output mangling on
such systems, set the "encoding" option to
"roff" (the default in earlier Pod::Man versions).
See the "encoding" option and "ENCODING"
for more details.</p>
<p style="margin-left:9%; margin-top: 1em">See
"COMPATIBILTY" for the versions of Pod::Man with
significant backward−incompatible changes (other than
constructor options, whose versions are documented below),
and the versions of Perl that included them.</p>
<h2>CLASS METHODS
<a name="CLASS METHODS"></a>
</h2>
<p style="margin-left:9%; margin-top: 1em">new(ARGS)</p>
<p style="margin-left:14%;">Create a new Pod::Man object.
ARGS should be a list of key/value pairs, where the keys are
chosen from the following. Each option is annotated with the
version of Pod::Man in which that option was added with its
current meaning. <br/>
center</p>
<p style="margin-left:19%;">[1.00] Sets the centered page
header for the ".TH" macro. The default, if this
option is not specified, is "User Contributed Perl
Documentation".</p>
<p style="margin-left:14%;">date</p>
<p style="margin-left:19%;">[4.00] Sets the left−hand
footer for the ".TH" macro. If this option is not
set, the contents of the environment variable POD_MAN_DATE,
if set, will be used. Failing that, the value of
SOURCE_DATE_EPOCH, the modification date of the input file,
or the current time if <b>stat()</b> can't find that file
(which will be the case if the input is from
"STDIN") will be used. If taken from any source
other than POD_MAN_DATE (which is used verbatim), the date
will be formatted as "YYYY−MM−DD" and
will be based on UTC (so that the output will be
reproducible regardless of local time zone).</p>
<p style="margin-left:14%;">encoding</p>
<p style="margin-left:19%;">[5.00] Specifies the encoding
of the output. The value must be an encoding recognized by
the Encode module (see Encode::Supported), or the special
values "roff" or "groff". The default on
non−EBCDIC systems is UTF−8.</p>
<p style="margin-left:19%; margin-top: 1em">If the output
contains characters that cannot be represented in this
encoding, that is an error that will be reported as
configured by the "errors" option. If error
handling is other than "die", the unrepresentable
character will be replaced with the Encode substitution
character (normally "?").</p>
<p style="margin-left:19%; margin-top: 1em">If the
"encoding" option is set to the special value
"groff" (the default on EBCDIC systems), or if the
Encode module is not available and the encoding is set to
anything other than "roff", Pod::Man will
translate all non−ASCII characters to
"\[uNNNN]" Unicode escapes. These are not
traditionally part of the *roff language, but are supported
by <b>groff</b> and <b>mandoc</b> and thus by the majority
of manual page processors in use today.</p>
<p style="margin-left:19%; margin-top: 1em">If the
"encoding" option is set to the special value
"roff", Pod::Man will do its historic
transformation of (some) ISO 8859−1 characters into
*roff escapes that may be adequate in troff and may be
readable (if ugly) in nroff. This was the default behavior
of versions of Pod::Man before 5.00. With this encoding, all
other non−ASCII characters will be replaced with
"X". It may be required for very old troff and
nroff implementations that do not support UTF−8, but
its representation of any non−ASCII character is very
poor and often specific to European languages.</p>
<p style="margin-left:19%; margin-top: 1em">If the output
file handle has a PerlIO encoding layer set, setting
"encoding" to anything other than
"groff" or "roff" will be ignored and no
encoding will be done by Pod::Man. It will instead rely on
the encoding layer to make whatever output encoding
transformations are desired.</p>
<p style="margin-left:19%; margin-top: 1em">WARNING: The
input encoding of the POD source is independent from the
output encoding, and setting this option does not affect the
interpretation of the POD input. Unless your POD source is
US−ASCII, its encoding should be declared with the
"=encoding" command in the source. If this is not
done, Pod::Simple will will attempt to guess the encoding
and may be successful if it's Latin−1 or UTF−8,
but it will produce warnings. See <b>perlpod</b>(1) for more
information.</p>
<p style="margin-left:14%;">errors</p>
<p style="margin-left:19%;">[2.27] How to report errors.
"die" says to throw an exception on any POD
formatting error. "stderr" says to report errors
on standard error, but not to throw an exception.
"pod" says to include a POD ERRORS section in the
resulting documentation summarizing the errors.
"none" ignores POD errors entirely, as much as
possible.</p>
<p style="margin-left:19%; margin-top: 1em">The default is
"pod".</p>
<p style="margin-left:14%;">fixed</p>
<p style="margin-left:19%;">[1.00] The fixed−width
font to use for verbatim text and code. Defaults to
"CW". Some systems prefer "CR" instead.
Only matters for <b>troff</b> output.</p>
<p style="margin-left:14%;">fixedbold</p>
<p style="margin-left:19%;">[1.00] Bold version of the
fixed−width font. Defaults to "CB". Only
matters for <b>troff</b> output.</p>
<p style="margin-left:14%;">fixeditalic</p>
<p style="margin-left:19%;">[1.00] Italic version of the
fixed−width font (something of a misnomer, since most
fixed−width fonts only have an oblique version, not an
italic version). Defaults to "CI". Only matters
for <b>troff</b> output.</p>
<p style="margin-left:14%;">fixedbolditalic</p>
<p style="margin-left:19%;">[1.00] Bold italic (in theory,
probably oblique in practice) version of the
fixed−width font. Pod::Man doesn't assume you have
this, and defaults to "CB". Some systems (such as
Solaris) have this font available as "CX". Only
matters for <b>troff</b> output.</p>
<p style="margin-left:14%;">guesswork</p>
<p style="margin-left:19%;">[5.00] By default, Pod::Man
applies some default formatting rules based on guesswork and
regular expressions that are intended to make writing Perl
documentation easier and require less explicit markup. These
rules may not always be appropriate, particularly for
documentation that isn't about Perl. This option allows
turning all or some of it off.</p>
<p style="margin-left:19%; margin-top: 1em">The special
value "all" enables all guesswork. This is also
the default for backward compatibility reasons. The special
value "none" disables all guesswork. Otherwise,
the value of this option should be a comma−separated
list of one or more of the following keywords: <br/>
functions</p>
<p style="margin-left:24%;">Convert function references
like foo() to bold even if they have no markup. The function
name accepts valid Perl characters for function names
(including ":"), and the trailing parentheses must
be present and empty.</p>
<p style="margin-left:19%;">manref</p>
<p style="margin-left:24%;">Make the first part (before the
parentheses) of manual page references like foo(1) bold even
if they have no markup. The section must be a single number
optionally followed by lowercase letters.</p>
<p style="margin-left:19%;">quoting</p>
<p style="margin-left:24%;">If no guesswork is enabled, any
text enclosed in C&lt;&gt; is surrounded by double quotes in
nroff (terminal) output unless the contents are already
quoted. When this guesswork is enabled, quote marks will
also be suppressed for Perl variables, function names,
function calls, numbers, and hex constants.</p>
<p style="margin-left:19%;">variables</p>
<p style="margin-left:24%;">Convert Perl variable names to
a fixed−width font even if they have no markup. This
transformation will only be apparent in troff output, or
some other output format (unlike nroff terminal output) that
supports fixed−width fonts.</p>
<p style="margin-left:19%; margin-top: 1em">Any unknown
guesswork name is silently ignored (for potential future
compatibility), so be careful about spelling.</p>
<p style="margin-left:14%;">language</p>
<p style="margin-left:19%;">[5.00] Add commands telling
<b>groff</b> that the input file is in the given language.
The value of this setting must be a language abbreviation
for which <b>groff</b> provides supplemental configuration,
such as "ja" (for Japanese) or "zh" (for
Chinese).</p>
<p style="margin-left:19%; margin-top: 1em">Specifically,
this adds:</p>
<p style="margin-left:19%; margin-top: 1em">.mso
&lt;language&gt;.tmac <br/>
.hla &lt;language&gt;</p>
<p style="margin-left:19%; margin-top: 1em">to the start of
the file, which configure correct line breaking for the
specified language. Without these commands, groff may not
know how to add proper line breaks for Chinese and Japanese
text if the manual page is installed into the normal manual
page directory, such as <i>/usr/share/man</i>.</p>
<p style="margin-left:19%; margin-top: 1em">On many
systems, this will be done automatically if the manual page
is installed into a language−specific manual page
directory, such as <i>/usr/share/man/zh_CN</i>. In that
case, this option is not required.</p>
<p style="margin-left:19%; margin-top: 1em">Unfortunately,
the commands added with this option are specific to
<b>groff</b> and will not work with other <b>troff</b> and
<b>nroff</b> implementations.</p>
<p style="margin-left:14%;">lquote <br/>
rquote</p>
<p style="margin-left:19%;">[4.08] Sets the quote marks
used to surround C&lt;&gt; text. "lquote" sets the
left quote mark and "rquote" sets the right quote
mark. Either may also be set to the special value
"none", in which case no quote mark is added on
that side of C&lt;&gt; text (but the font is still changed
for troff output).</p>
<p style="margin-left:19%; margin-top: 1em">Also see the
"quotes" option, which can be used to set both
quotes at once. If both "quotes" and one of the
other options is set, "lquote" or
"rquote" overrides "quotes".</p>
<p style="margin-left:14%;">name</p>
<p style="margin-left:19%;">[4.08] Set the name of the
manual page for the ".TH" macro. Without this
option, the manual name is set to the uppercased base name
of the file being converted unless the manual section is 3,
in which case the path is parsed to see if it is a Perl
module path. If it is, a path like
".../lib/Pod/Man.pm" is converted into a name like
"Pod::Man". This option, if given, overrides any
automatic determination of the name.</p>
<p style="margin-left:19%; margin-top: 1em">If generating a
manual page from standard input, the name will be set to
"STDIN" if this option is not provided. In this
case, providing this option is strongly recommended to set a
meaningful manual page name.</p>
<p style="margin-left:14%;">nourls</p>
<p style="margin-left:19%;">[2.27] Normally, L&lt;&gt;
formatting codes with a URL but anchor text are formatted to
show both the anchor text and the URL. In other words:</p>
<p style="margin-left:19%; margin-top: 1em">L&lt;foo|http://example.com/&gt;</p>
<p style="margin-left:19%; margin-top: 1em">is formatted
as:</p>
<p style="margin-left:19%; margin-top: 1em">foo
&lt;http://example.com/&gt;</p>
<p style="margin-left:19%; margin-top: 1em">This option, if
set to a true value, suppresses the URL when anchor text is
given, so this example would be formatted as just
"foo". This can produce less cluttered output in
cases where the URLs are not particularly important.</p>
<p style="margin-left:14%;">quotes</p>
<p style="margin-left:19%;">[4.00] Sets the quote marks
used to surround C&lt;&gt; text. If the value is a single
character, it is used as both the left and right quote.
Otherwise, it is split in half, and the first half of the
string is used as the left quote and the second is used as
the right quote.</p>
<p style="margin-left:19%; margin-top: 1em">This may also
be set to the special value "none", in which case
no quote marks are added around C&lt;&gt; text (but the font
is still changed for troff output).</p>
<p style="margin-left:19%; margin-top: 1em">Also see the
"lquote" and "rquote" options, which can
be used to set the left and right quotes independently. If
both "quotes" and one of the other options is set,
"lquote" or "rquote" overrides
"quotes".</p>
<p style="margin-left:14%;">release</p>
<p style="margin-left:19%;">[1.00] Set the centered footer
for the ".TH" macro. By default, this is set to
the version of Perl you run Pod::Man under. Setting this to
the empty string will cause some *roff implementations to
use the system default value.</p>
<p style="margin-left:19%; margin-top: 1em">Note that some
system "an" macro sets assume that the centered
footer will be a modification date and will prepend
something like "Last modified: ". If this is the
case for your target system, you may want to set
"release" to the last modified date and
"date" to the version number.</p>
<p style="margin-left:14%;">section</p>
<p style="margin-left:19%;">[1.00] Set the section for the
".TH" macro. The standard section numbering
convention is to use 1 for user commands, 2 for system
calls, 3 for functions, 4 for devices, 5 for file formats, 6
for games, 7 for miscellaneous information, and 8 for
administrator commands. There is a lot of variation here,
however; some systems (like Solaris) use 4 for file formats,
5 for miscellaneous information, and 7 for devices. Still
others use 1m instead of 8, or some mix of both. About the
only section numbers that are reliably consistent are 1, 2,
and 3.</p>
<p style="margin-left:19%; margin-top: 1em">By default,
section 1 will be used unless the file ends in
".pm" in which case section 3 will be
selected.</p>
<p style="margin-left:14%;">stderr</p>
<p style="margin-left:19%;">[2.19] If set to a true value,
send error messages about invalid POD to standard error
instead of appending a POD ERRORS section to the generated
*roff output. This is equivalent to setting
"errors" to "stderr" if
"errors" is not already set.</p>
<p style="margin-left:19%; margin-top: 1em">This option is
for backward compatibility with Pod::Man versions that did
not support "errors". Normally, the
"errors" option should be used instead.</p>
<p style="margin-left:14%;">utf8</p>
<p style="margin-left:19%;">[2.21] This option used to set
the output encoding to UTF−8. Since this is now the
default, it is ignored and does nothing.</p>
<h2>INSTANCE METHODS
<a name="INSTANCE METHODS"></a>
</h2>
<p style="margin-left:9%; margin-top: 1em">As a derived
class from Pod::Simple, Pod::Man supports the same methods
and interfaces. See Pod::Simple for all the details. This
section summarizes the most−frequently−used
methods and the ones added by Pod::Man. <br/>
output_fh(FH)</p>
<p style="margin-left:14%;">Direct the output from
<b>parse_file()</b>, <b>parse_lines()</b>, or
<b>parse_string_document()</b> to the file handle FH instead
of "STDOUT".</p>
<p style="margin-left:9%;">output_string(REF)</p>
<p style="margin-left:14%;">Direct the output from
<b>parse_file()</b>, <b>parse_lines()</b>, or
<b>parse_string_document()</b> to the scalar variable
pointed to by REF, rather than "STDOUT". For
example:</p>
<p style="margin-left:14%; margin-top: 1em">my $man =
Pod::Man−&gt;new(); <br/>
my $output; <br/>
$man−&gt;output_string(\$output); <br/>
$man−&gt;parse_file('/some/input/file');</p>
<p style="margin-left:14%; margin-top: 1em">Be aware that
the output in that variable will already be encoded in
UTF−8.</p>
<p style="margin-left:9%;">parse_file(PATH)</p>
<p style="margin-left:14%;">Read the POD source from PATH
and format it. By default, the output is sent to
"STDOUT", but this can be changed with the
<b>output_fh()</b> or <b>output_string()</b> methods.</p>
<p style="margin-left:9%;">parse_from_file(INPUT, OUTPUT)
<br/>
parse_from_filehandle(FH, OUTPUT)</p>
<p style="margin-left:14%;">Read the POD source from INPUT,
format it, and output the results to OUTPUT.</p>
<p style="margin-left:14%; margin-top: 1em"><b>parse_from_filehandle()</b>
is provided for backward compatibility with older versions
of Pod::Man. <b>parse_from_file()</b> should be used
instead.</p>
<p style="margin-left:9%;">parse_lines(LINES[, ...[,
undef]])</p>
<p style="margin-left:14%;">Parse the provided lines as POD
source, writing the output to either "STDOUT" or
the file handle set with the <b>output_fh()</b> or
<b>output_string()</b> methods. This method can be called
repeatedly to provide more input lines. An explicit
"undef" should be passed to indicate the end of
input.</p>
<p style="margin-left:14%; margin-top: 1em">This method
expects raw bytes, not decoded characters.</p>
<p style="margin-left:9%;">parse_string_document(INPUT)</p>
<p style="margin-left:14%;">Parse the provided scalar
variable as POD source, writing the output to either
"STDOUT" or the file handle set with the
<b>output_fh()</b> or <b>output_string()</b> methods.</p>
<p style="margin-left:14%; margin-top: 1em">This method
expects raw bytes, not decoded characters.</p>
<h2>ENCODING
<a name="ENCODING"></a>
</h2>
<p style="margin-left:9%; margin-top: 1em">As of Pod::Man
5.00, the default output encoding for Pod::Man is
UTF−8. This should work correctly on any modern system
that uses either <b>groff</b> (most Linux distributions) or
<b>mandoc</b> (Alpine Linux and most BSD variants, including
macOS).</p>
<p style="margin-left:9%; margin-top: 1em">The user will
probably have to use a UTF−8 locale to see correct
output. This may be done by default; if not, set the LANG or
LC_CTYPE environment variables to an appropriate local. The
locale "C.UTF−8" is available on most
systems if one wants correct output without changing the
other things locales affect, such as collation.</p>
<p style="margin-left:9%; margin-top: 1em">The
backward−compatible output format used in Pod::Man
versions before 5.00 is available by setting the
"encoding" option to "roff". This may
produce marginally nicer results on older UNIX versions that
do not use <b>groff</b> or <b>mandoc</b>, but none of the
available options will correctly render Unicode characters
on those systems.</p>
<p style="margin-left:9%; margin-top: 1em">Below are some
additional details about how this choice was made and some
discussion of alternatives.</p>
<h3>History
<a name="History"></a>
</h3>
<p style="margin-left:9%; margin-top: 1em">The default
output encoding for Pod::Man has been a long−standing
problem. <b>troff</b> and <b>nroff</b> predate Unicode by a
significant margin, and their implementations for many UNIX
systems reflect that legacy. It's common for Unicode to not
be supported in any form.</p>
<p style="margin-left:9%; margin-top: 1em">Because of this,
versions of Pod::Man prior to 5.00 maintained the highly
conservative output of the original pod2man, which output
pure ASCII with complex macros to simulate common western
European accented characters when processed with troff. The
nroff output was awkward and sometimes incorrect, and
characters not used in western European scripts were
replaced with "X". This choice maximized backwards
compatibility with <b>man</b> and <b>nroff</b>/<b>troff</b>
implementations at the cost of incorrect rendering of many
POD documents, particularly those containing people's
names.</p>
<p style="margin-left:9%; margin-top: 1em">The modern
implementations, <b>groff</b> (used in most Linux
distributions) and <b>mandoc</b> (used by most BSD
variants), do now support Unicode. Other UNIX systems often
do not, but they're now a tiny minority of the systems
people use on a daily basis. It's increasingly common (for
very good reasons) to use Unicode characters for POD
documents rather than using ASCII conversions of people's
names or avoiding non−English text, making the
limitations in the old output format more apparent.</p>
<p style="margin-left:9%; margin-top: 1em">Four options
have been proposed to fix this:</p>
<table border="0" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" frame="void" rules="none" width="100%">
<tr align="left" valign="top">
<td width="9%"></td>
<td width="1%">
<p>•</p></td>
<td width="2%"></td>
<td width="88%">
<p>Optionally support UTF−8 output but don't change
the default. This is the approach taken since Pod::Man
2.1.0, which added the "utf8" option. Some
Pod::Man users use this option for better output on
platforms known to support Unicode, but since the defaults
have not changed, people continued to encounter (and file
bug reports about) the poor default rendering.</p></td></tr>
<tr align="left" valign="top">
<td width="9%"></td>
<td width="1%">
<p>•</p></td>
<td width="2%"></td>
<td width="88%">
<p>Convert characters to troff "\(xx" escapes.
This requires maintaining a large translation table and
addresses only a tiny part of the problem, since many
Unicode characters have no standard troff name. <b>groff</b>
has the largest list, but if one is willing to assume
<b>groff</b> is the formatter, the next option is
better.</p> </td></tr>
<tr align="left" valign="top">
<td width="9%"></td>
<td width="1%">
<p>•</p></td>
<td width="2%"></td>
<td width="88%">
<p>Convert characters to groff "\[uNNNN]"
escapes. This is implemented as the "groff"
encoding for those who want to use it, and is supported by
both <b>groff</b> and <b>mandoc</b>. However, it is no
better than UTF−8 output for portability to other
implementations. See "Testing results" for more
details.</p> </td></tr>
<tr align="left" valign="top">
<td width="9%"></td>
<td width="1%">
<p>•</p></td>
<td width="2%"></td>
<td width="88%">
<p>Change the default output format to UTF−8 and ask
those who want maximum backward compatibility to explicitly
select the old encoding. This fixes the issue for most users
at the cost of backwards compatibility. While the rendering
of non−ASCII characters is different on older systems
that don't support UTF−8, it's not always worse than
the old output.</p></td></tr>
</table>
<p style="margin-left:9%; margin-top: 1em">Pod::Man 5.00
and later makes the last choice. This arguably produces
worse output when manual pages are formatted with
<b>troff</b> into PostScript or PDF, but doing this is rare
and normally manual, so the encoding can be changed in those
cases. The older output encoding is available by setting
"encoding" to "roff".</p>
<h3>Testing results
<a name="Testing results"></a>
</h3>
<p style="margin-left:9%; margin-top: 1em">Here is the
results of testing "encoding" values of
"utf−8" and "groff" on various
operating systems. The testing methodology was to create
<i>man/man1</i> in the current directory, copy
<i>encoding.utf8</i> or <i>encoding.groff</i> from the
podlators 5.00 distribution to <i>man/man1/encoding.1</i>,
and then run:</p>
<p style="margin-left:9%; margin-top: 1em">LANG=C.UTF−8
MANPATH=$(pwd)/man man 1 encoding</p>
<p style="margin-left:9%; margin-top: 1em">If the locale is
not explicitly set to one that includes UTF−8, the
Unicode characters were usually converted to ASCII (by, for
example, dropping an accent) or deleted or replaced with
"&lt;?&gt;" if there was no conversion.</p>
<p style="margin-left:9%; margin-top: 1em">Tested on
2022−09−25. Many thanks to the GCC Compile Farm
project for access to testing hosts.</p>

<h2>COMPATIBILITY
<a name="COMPATIBILITY"></a>
</h2>
<p style="margin-left:9%; margin-top: 1em">Pod::Man 1.02
(based on Pod::Parser) was the first version included with
Perl, in Perl 5.6.0.</p>
<p style="margin-left:9%; margin-top: 1em">The current API
based on Pod::Simple was added in Pod::Man 2.00. Pod::Man
2.04 was included in Perl 5.9.3, the first version of Perl
to incorporate those changes. This is the first version that
correctly supports all modern POD syntax. The
<b>parse_from_filehandle()</b> method was re−added for
backward compatibility in Pod::Man 2.09, included in Perl
5.9.4.</p>
<p style="margin-left:9%; margin-top: 1em">Support for
anchor text in L&lt;&gt; links of type URL was added in
Pod::Man 2.23, included in Perl 5.11.5.</p>
<p style="margin-left:9%; margin-top: 1em"><b>parse_lines()</b>,
<b>parse_string_document()</b>, and <b>parse_file()</b> set
a default output file handle of "STDOUT" if one
was not already set as of Pod::Man 2.28, included in Perl
5.19.5.</p>
<p style="margin-left:9%; margin-top: 1em">Support for
SOURCE_DATE_EPOCH and POD_MAN_DATE was added in Pod::Man
4.00, included in Perl 5.23.7, and generated dates were
changed to use UTC instead of the local time zone. This is
also the first release that aligned the module version and
the version of the podlators distribution. All modules
included in podlators, and the podlators distribution
itself, share the same version number from this point
forward.</p>
<p style="margin-left:9%; margin-top: 1em">Pod::Man 4.10,
included in Perl 5.27.8, changed the formatting for manual
page references and function names to bold instead of
italic, following the current Linux manual page
standard.</p>
<p style="margin-left:9%; margin-top: 1em">Pod::Man 5.00,
included in Perl 5.37.7, changed the default output encoding
to UTF−8, overridable with the new
"encoding" option. It also fixed problems with
bold or italic extending too far when used with C&lt;&gt;
escapes, and began converting Unicode zero−width
spaces (U+200B) to the "\:" *roff escape. It also
dropped attempts to add subtle formatting corrections in the
output that would only be visible when typeset with
<b>troff</b>, which had previously been a significant source
of bugs.</p>
<p style="margin-left:9%; margin-top: 1em">Pod::Man v6.0.0
and later unconditionally convert "−" to the
"\−" *roff escape, representing an ASCII
hyphen−minus. Earlier versions attempted to use
heuristics to decide when a given "−"
character should translate to a hyphen−minus or a true
hyphen, but these heuristics were buggy and fragile. v6.0.0
and later also unconditionally convert "`" and
"'" to ASCII grave accent and apostrophe marks
instead of the default *roff behavior of interpreting them
as paired quotes.</p>
<h2>BUGS
<a name="BUGS"></a>
</h2>
<p style="margin-left:9%; margin-top: 1em">There are
numerous bugs and language−specific assumptions in the
nroff fallbacks for accented characters in the
"roff" encoding. Since the point of this encoding
is backward compatibility with the output from earlier
versions of Pod::Man, and it is deprecated except when
necessary to support old systems, those bugs are unlikely to
ever be fixed.</p>
<p style="margin-left:9%; margin-top: 1em">Pod::Man doesn't
handle font names longer than two characters. Neither do
most <b>troff</b> implementations, but groff does as an
extension. It would be nice to support as an option for
those who want to use it.</p>
<h2>CAVEATS
<a name="CAVEATS"></a>
</h2>
<h3>Sentence spacing
<a name="Sentence spacing"></a>
</h3>
<p style="margin-left:9%; margin-top: 1em">Pod::Man copies
the input spacing verbatim to the output *roff document.
This means your output will be affected by how <b>nroff</b>
generally handles sentence spacing.</p>
<p style="margin-left:9%; margin-top: 1em"><b>nroff</b>
dates from an era in which it was standard to use two spaces
after sentences, and will always add two spaces after a
line−ending period (or similar punctuation) when
reflowing text. For example, the following input:</p>
<p style="margin-left:9%; margin-top: 1em">=pod <br/>
One sentence. <br/>
Another sentence.</p>
<p style="margin-left:9%; margin-top: 1em">will result in
two spaces after the period when the text is reflowed. If
you use two spaces after sentences anyway, this will be
consistent, although you will have to be careful to not end
a line with an abbreviation such as "e.g." or
"Ms.". Output will also be consistent if you use
the *roff style guide (and XKCD 1285
&lt;https://xkcd.com/1285/&gt;) recommendation of putting a
line break after each sentence, although that will
consistently produce two spaces after each sentence, which
may not be what you want.</p>
<p style="margin-left:9%; margin-top: 1em">If you prefer
one space after sentences (which is the more modern style),
you will unfortunately need to ensure that no line in the
middle of a paragraph ends in a period or similar
sentence−ending paragraph. Otherwise, <b>nroff</b>
will add a two spaces after that sentence when reflowing,
and your output document will have inconsistent spacing.</p>
<h3>Hyphens and quotes
<a name="Hyphens and quotes"></a>
</h3>
<p style="margin-left:9%; margin-top: 1em">The *roff
language distinguishes between two types of hyphens:
"−", which is a true typesetting hyphen
(roughly equivalent to the Unicode U+2010 code point), and
"\−", which is the ASCII hyphen−minus
(U+002D) that is used for UNIX command options and most
filenames. Hyphens, where appropriate, produce better
typesetting, but incorrectly using them for command names
and options can cause problems with searching and
cut−and−paste.</p>
<p style="margin-left:9%; margin-top: 1em">POD does not
draw this distinction. Before podlators v6.0.0, Pod::Man
attempted to translate "−" in the input into
either a hyphen or a hyphen−minus, depending on
context. However, this distinction proved impossible to do
correctly with heuristics. Pod::Man therefore translates all
"−" characters in the input to
"\−" in the output, ensuring that command
names and options are correct at the cost of somewhat
inferior typesetting and line breaking issues with long
hyphenated phrases.</p>
<p style="margin-left:9%; margin-top: 1em">To use true
hyphens in the Pod::Man output, declare an input character
set of UTF−8 (or some other Unicode encoding) and use
Unicode hyphens. Pod::Man and *roff should handle those
correctly with the default output format and most modern
*roff implementations.</p>
<p style="margin-left:9%; margin-top: 1em">Similarly,
Pod::Man disables the default *roff behavior of turning
"`" and "'" characters into matched
quotes, and pairs of those characters into matched double
quotes, because there is no good way to tell from the POD
input whether this interpretation is desired or whether the
intent is to use a literal grave accent or neutral
apostrophe. If you want paired quotes in the output, use
Unicode and its paired quote characters.</p>
