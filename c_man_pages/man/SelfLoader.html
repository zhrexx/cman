<h2>NAME
<a name="NAME"></a>
</h2>
<p style="margin-left:9%; margin-top: 1em">SelfLoader
− load functions only on demand</p>
<h2>SYNOPSIS
<a name="SYNOPSIS"></a>
</h2>
<p style="margin-left:9%; margin-top: 1em">package FOOBAR;
<br/>
use SelfLoader; <br/>
... (initializing code) <br/>
__DATA__ <br/>
sub {....</p>
<h2>DESCRIPTION
<a name="DESCRIPTION"></a>
</h2>
<p style="margin-left:9%; margin-top: 1em">This module
tells its users that functions in the FOOBAR package are to
be autoloaded from after the "__DATA__" token. See
also "Autoloading" in perlsub.</p>
<h3>The __DATA__ token
<a name="The __DATA__ token"></a>
</h3>
<p style="margin-left:9%; margin-top: 1em">The
"__DATA__" token tells the perl compiler that the
perl code for compilation is finished. Everything after the
"__DATA__" token is available for reading via the
filehandle FOOBAR::DATA, where FOOBAR is the name of the
current package when the "__DATA__" token is
reached. This works just the same as "__END__"
does in package ’main’, but for other modules
data after "__END__" is not automatically
retrievable, whereas data after "__DATA__" is. The
"__DATA__" token is not recognized in versions of
perl prior to 5.001m.</p>
<p style="margin-left:9%; margin-top: 1em">Note that it is
possible to have "__DATA__" tokens in the same
package in multiple files, and that the last
"__DATA__" token in a given package that is
encountered by the compiler is the one accessible by the
filehandle. This also applies to "__END__" and
main, i.e. if the ’main’ program has an
"__END__", but a module ’require’d
(_not_ ’use’d) by that program has a
’package main;’ declaration followed by an
’"__DATA__"’, then the
"DATA" filehandle is set to access the data after
the "__DATA__" in the module, _not_ the data after
the "__END__" token in the ’main’
program, since the compiler encounters the
’require’d file later.</p>
<h3>SelfLoader autoloading
<a name="SelfLoader autoloading"></a>
</h3>
<p style="margin-left:9%; margin-top: 1em">The
<b>SelfLoader</b> works by the user placing the
"__DATA__" token <i>after</i> perl code which
needs to be compiled and run at ’require’ time,
but <i>before</i> subroutine declarations that can be loaded
in later − usually because they may never be
called.</p>
<p style="margin-left:9%; margin-top: 1em">The
<b>SelfLoader</b> will read from the FOOBAR::DATA filehandle
to load in the data after "__DATA__", and load in
any subroutine when it is called. The costs are the one-time
parsing of the data after "__DATA__", and a load
delay for the _first_ call of any autoloaded function. The
benefits (hopefully) are a speeded up compilation phase,
with no need to load functions which are never used.</p>
<p style="margin-left:9%; margin-top: 1em">The
<b>SelfLoader</b> will stop reading from
"__DATA__" if it encounters the
"__END__" token − just as you would expect.
If the "__END__" token is present, and is followed
by the token DATA, then the <b>SelfLoader</b> leaves the
FOOBAR::DATA filehandle open on the line after that
token.</p>
<p style="margin-left:9%; margin-top: 1em">The
<b>SelfLoader</b> exports the "AUTOLOAD"
subroutine to the package using the <b>SelfLoader</b>, and
this loads the called subroutine when it is first
called.</p>
<p style="margin-left:9%; margin-top: 1em">There is no
advantage to putting subroutines which will _always_ be
called after the "__DATA__" token.</p>
<h3>Autoloading and package lexicals
<a name="Autoloading and package lexicals"></a>
</h3>
<p style="margin-left:9%; margin-top: 1em">A ’my
$pack_lexical’ statement makes the variable
$pack_lexical local _only_ to the file up to the
"__DATA__" token. Subroutines declared elsewhere
_cannot_ see these types of variables, just as if you
declared subroutines in the package but in another file,
they cannot see these variables.</p>
<p style="margin-left:9%; margin-top: 1em">So specifically,
autoloaded functions cannot see package lexicals (this
applies to both the <b>SelfLoader</b> and the Autoloader).
The "vars" pragma provides an alternative to
defining package-level globals that will be visible to
autoloaded routines. See the documentation on <b>vars</b> in
the pragma section of perlmod.</p>
<h3>SelfLoader and AutoLoader
<a name="SelfLoader and AutoLoader"></a>
</h3>
<p style="margin-left:9%; margin-top: 1em">The
<b>SelfLoader</b> can replace the AutoLoader − just
change ’use AutoLoader’ to ’use
SelfLoader’ (though note that the <b>SelfLoader</b>
exports the AUTOLOAD function − but if you have your
own AUTOLOAD and are using the AutoLoader too, you probably
know what you’re doing), and the "__END__"
token to "__DATA__". You will need perl version
5.001m or later to use this (version 5.001 with all patches
up to patch m).</p>
<p style="margin-left:9%; margin-top: 1em">There is no need
to inherit from the <b>SelfLoader</b>.</p>
<p style="margin-left:9%; margin-top: 1em">The
<b>SelfLoader</b> works similarly to the AutoLoader, but
picks up the subs from after the "__DATA__"
instead of in the ’lib/auto’ directory. There is
a maintenance gain in not needing to run AutoSplit on the
module at installation, and a runtime gain in not needing to
keep opening and closing files to load subs. There is a
runtime loss in needing to parse the code after the
"__DATA__". Details of the <b>AutoLoader</b> and
another view of these distinctions can be found in that
module’s documentation.</p>
<h3>__DATA__, __END__, and the FOOBAR::DATA filehandle
<a name="__DATA__, __END__, and the FOOBAR::DATA filehandle"></a>
</h3>
<p style="margin-left:9%; margin-top: 1em">This section is
only relevant if you want to use the
"FOOBAR::DATA" together with the
<b>SelfLoader</b>.</p>
<p style="margin-left:9%; margin-top: 1em">Data after the
"__DATA__" token in a module is read using the
FOOBAR::DATA filehandle. "__END__" can still be
used to denote the end of the "__DATA__" section
if followed by the token DATA − this is supported by
the <b>SelfLoader</b>. The "FOOBAR::DATA"
filehandle is left open if an "__END__" followed
by a DATA is found, with the filehandle positioned at the
start of the line after the "__END__" token. If no
"__END__" token is present, or an
"__END__" token with no DATA token on the same
line, then the filehandle is closed.</p>
<p style="margin-left:9%; margin-top: 1em">The
<b>SelfLoader</b> reads from wherever the current position
of the "FOOBAR::DATA" filehandle is, until the EOF
or "__END__". This means that if you want to use
that filehandle (and ONLY if you want to), you should
either</p>
<p style="margin-left:9%; margin-top: 1em">1. Put all your
subroutine declarations immediately after the
"__DATA__" token and put your own data after those
declarations, using the "__END__" token to mark
the end of subroutine declarations. You must also ensure
that the <b>SelfLoader</b> reads first by calling
’SelfLoader−&gt;<b>load_stubs()</b>;’, or
by using a function which is selfloaded;</p>
<p style="margin-left:9%; margin-top: 1em">or</p>
<p style="margin-left:9%; margin-top: 1em">2. You should
read the "FOOBAR::DATA" filehandle first, leaving
the handle open and positioned at the first line of
subroutine declarations.</p>
<p style="margin-left:9%; margin-top: 1em">You could
conceivably do both.</p>
<h3>Classes and inherited methods
<a name="Classes and inherited methods"></a>
</h3>
<p style="margin-left:9%; margin-top: 1em">For modules
which are not classes, this section is not relevant. This
section is only relevant if you have methods which could be
inherited.</p>
<p style="margin-left:9%; margin-top: 1em">A subroutine
stub (or forward declaration) looks like</p>
<p style="margin-left:9%; margin-top: 1em">sub stub;</p>
<p style="margin-left:9%; margin-top: 1em">i.e. it is a
subroutine declaration without the body of the subroutine.
For modules which are not classes, there is no real need for
stubs as far as autoloading is concerned.</p>
<p style="margin-left:9%; margin-top: 1em">For modules
which ARE classes, and need to handle inherited methods,
stubs are needed to ensure that the method inheritance
mechanism works properly. You can load the stubs into the
module at ’require’ time, by adding the
statement
’SelfLoader−&gt;<b>load_stubs()</b>;’ to
the module to do this.</p>
<p style="margin-left:9%; margin-top: 1em">The alternative
is to put the stubs in before the "__DATA__" token
BEFORE releasing the module, and for this purpose the
"Devel::SelfStubber" module is available. However
this does require the extra step of ensuring that the stubs
are in the module. If this is done I strongly recommend that
this is done BEFORE releasing the module − it should
NOT be done at install time in general.</p>
<h2>Multiple packages and fully qualified subroutine names
<a name="Multiple packages and fully qualified subroutine names"></a>
</h2>
<p style="margin-left:9%; margin-top: 1em">Subroutines in
multiple packages within the same file are supported −
but you should note that this requires exporting the
"SelfLoader::AUTOLOAD" to every package which
requires it. This is done automatically by the
<b>SelfLoader</b> when it first loads the subs into the
cache, but you should really specify it in the
initialization before the "__DATA__" by putting a
’use SelfLoader’ statement in each package.</p>
<p style="margin-left:9%; margin-top: 1em">Fully qualified
subroutine names are also supported. For example,</p>
<p style="margin-left:9%; margin-top: 1em">__DATA__ <br/>
sub foo::bar {23} <br/>
package baz; <br/>
sub dob {32}</p>
<p style="margin-left:9%; margin-top: 1em">will all be
loaded correctly by the <b>SelfLoader</b>, and the
<b>SelfLoader</b> will ensure that the packages
’foo’ and ’baz’ correctly have the
<b>SelfLoader</b> "AUTOLOAD" method when the data
after "__DATA__" is first parsed.</p>

such object code only adds definitions of subroutines and

consider linking in C subroutines in this manner to be the
moral equivalent of defining subroutines in the Perl
