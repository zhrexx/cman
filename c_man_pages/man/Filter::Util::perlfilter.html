− Source Filters</p>
<h2>DESCRIPTION
<a name="DESCRIPTION"></a>
</h2>
<p style="margin-left:9%; margin-top: 1em">This article is
about a little−known feature of Perl called <i>source
filters</i>. Source filters alter the program text of a
module before Perl sees it, much as a C preprocessor alters
the source text of a C program before the compiler sees it.
This article tells you more about what source filters are,
how they work, and how to write your own.</p>
<p style="margin-left:9%; margin-top: 1em">The original
purpose of source filters was to let you encrypt your
program source to prevent casual piracy. This isn't all they
can do, as you'll soon learn. But first, the basics.</p>
<h2>CONCEPTS
<a name="CONCEPTS"></a>
</h2>
<p style="margin-left:9%; margin-top: 1em">Before the Perl
interpreter can execute a Perl script, it must first read it
from a file into memory for parsing and compilation. If that
script itself includes other scripts with a "use"
or "require" statement, then each of those scripts
will have to be read from their respective files as
well.</p>
<p style="margin-left:9%; margin-top: 1em">Now think of
each logical connection between the Perl parser and an
individual file as a <i>source stream</i>. A source stream
is created when the Perl parser opens a file, it continues
to exist as the source code is read into memory, and it is
destroyed when Perl is finished parsing the file. If the
parser encounters a "require" or "use"
statement in a source stream, a new and distinct stream is
created just for that file.</p>
<p style="margin-left:9%; margin-top: 1em">The diagram
below represents a single source stream, with the flow of
source from a Perl script file on the left into the Perl
parser on the right. This is how Perl normally operates.</p>
<p style="margin-left:9%; margin-top: 1em">file
−−−−−−−&gt;
parser</p>
<p style="margin-left:9%; margin-top: 1em">There are two
important points to remember:</p>
<table border="0" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" frame="void" rules="none" width="100%">
<tr align="left" valign="top">
<td width="9%"></td>
<td width="3%">
<p>1.</p></td>
<td width="3%"></td>
<td width="85%">
<p>Although there can be any number of source streams in
existence at any given time, only one will be active.</p></td></tr>
<tr align="left" valign="top">
<td width="9%"></td>
<td width="3%">
<p>2.</p></td>
<td width="3%"></td>
<td width="85%">
<p>Every source stream is associated with only one
file.</p> </td></tr>
</table>
<p style="margin-left:9%; margin-top: 1em">A source filter
is a special kind of Perl module that intercepts and
modifies a source stream before it reaches the parser. A
source filter changes our diagram like this:</p>
<p style="margin-left:9%; margin-top: 1em">file
−−−−&gt; filter
−−−−&gt; parser</p>
<p style="margin-left:9%; margin-top: 1em">If that doesn't
make much sense, consider the analogy of a command pipeline.
Say you have a shell script stored in the compressed file
<i>trial.gz</i>. The simple pipeline command below runs the
script without needing to create a temporary file to hold
the uncompressed file.</p>
<p style="margin-left:9%; margin-top: 1em">gunzip −c
trial.gz | sh</p>
<p style="margin-left:9%; margin-top: 1em">In this case,
the data flow from the pipeline can be represented as
follows:</p>
<p style="margin-left:9%; margin-top: 1em">trial.gz
−−−−&gt; gunzip
−−−−&gt; sh</p>
<p style="margin-left:9%; margin-top: 1em">With source
filters, you can store the text of your script compressed
and use a source filter to uncompress it for Perl's
parser:</p>
<p style="margin-left:9%; margin-top: 1em">compressed
gunzip <br/>
Perl program −−−&gt; source filter
−−−&gt; parser</p>
<h2>USING FILTERS
<a name="USING FILTERS"></a>
</h2>
<p style="margin-left:9%; margin-top: 1em">So how do you
use a source filter in a Perl script? Above, I said that a
source filter is just a special kind of module. Like all
Perl modules, a source filter is invoked with a use
statement.</p>
<p style="margin-left:9%; margin-top: 1em">Say you want to
pass your Perl source through the C preprocessor before
execution. As it happens, the source filters distribution
comes with a C preprocessor filter module called
Filter::cpp.</p>
<p style="margin-left:9%; margin-top: 1em">Below is an
example program, "cpp_test", which makes use of
this filter. Line numbers have been added to allow specific
lines to be referenced easily.</p>
<p style="margin-left:9%; margin-top: 1em">1: use
Filter::cpp; <br/>
2: #define TRUE 1 <br/>
3: $a = TRUE; <br/>
4: print "a = $a\n";</p>
<p style="margin-left:9%; margin-top: 1em">When you execute
this script, Perl creates a source stream for the file.
Before the parser processes any of the lines from the file,
the source stream looks like this:</p>
<p style="margin-left:9%; margin-top: 1em">cpp_test
−−−−−−−−−&gt;
parser</p>
<p style="margin-left:9%; margin-top: 1em">Line 1,
"use Filter::cpp", includes and installs the
"cpp" filter module. All source filters work this
way. The use statement is compiled and executed at compile
time, before any more of the file is read, and it attaches
the cpp filter to the source stream behind the scenes. Now
the data flow looks like this:</p>
<p style="margin-left:9%; margin-top: 1em">cpp_test
−−−−&gt; cpp filter
−−−−&gt; parser</p>
<p style="margin-left:9%; margin-top: 1em">As the parser
reads the second and subsequent lines from the source
stream, it feeds those lines through the "cpp"
source filter before processing them. The "cpp"
filter simply passes each line through the real C
preprocessor. The output from the C preprocessor is then
inserted back into the source stream by the filter.</p>
<p style="margin-left:9%; margin-top: 1em">.−&gt; cpp
−−. <br/>
| | <br/>
| | <br/>
| &lt;−' <br/>
cpp_test −−−−&gt; cpp filter
−−−−&gt; parser</p>
<p style="margin-left:9%; margin-top: 1em">The parser then
sees the following code:</p>
<p style="margin-left:9%; margin-top: 1em">use Filter::cpp;
<br/>
$a = 1; <br/>
print "a = $a\n";</p>
<p style="margin-left:9%; margin-top: 1em">Let's consider
what happens when the filtered code includes another module
with use:</p>
<p style="margin-left:9%; margin-top: 1em">1: use
Filter::cpp; <br/>
2: #define TRUE 1 <br/>
3: use Fred; <br/>
4: $a = TRUE; <br/>
5: print "a = $a\n";</p>
<p style="margin-left:9%; margin-top: 1em">The
"cpp" filter does not apply to the text of the
Fred module, only to the text of the file that used it
("cpp_test"). Although the use statement on line 3
will pass through the cpp filter, the module that gets
included ("Fred") will not. The source streams
look like this after line 3 has been parsed and before line
4 is parsed:</p>
<p style="margin-left:9%; margin-top: 1em">cpp_test
−−−&gt; cpp filter
−−−&gt; parser (INACTIVE) <br/>
Fred.pm −−−−&gt; parser</p>
<p style="margin-left:9%; margin-top: 1em">As you can see,
a new stream has been created for reading the source from
"Fred.pm". This stream will remain active until
all of "Fred.pm" has been parsed. The source
stream for "cpp_test" will still exist, but is
inactive. Once the parser has finished reading Fred.pm, the
source stream associated with it will be destroyed. The
source stream for "cpp_test" then becomes active
again and the parser reads line 4 and subsequent lines from
"cpp_test".</p>
<p style="margin-left:9%; margin-top: 1em">You can use more
than one source filter on a single file. Similarly, you can
reuse the same filter in as many files as you like.</p>
<p style="margin-left:9%; margin-top: 1em">For example, if
you have a uuencoded and compressed source file, it is
possible to stack a uudecode filter and an uncompression
filter like this:</p>
<p style="margin-left:9%; margin-top: 1em">use
Filter::uudecode; use Filter::uncompress; <br/>

M'XL(".H&lt;US4''V9I;F%L')Q;&gt;7/;1I;_&gt;_I3=&amp;E=%:F*I"T?22Q/
<br/>

M6]9*&lt;IQCO*XFT"0[PL%%'Y+IG?WNˆZYN−$'J.[.JE$,20/?K=_[&gt;
<br/>
...</p>
<p style="margin-left:9%; margin-top: 1em">Once the first
line has been processed, the flow will look like this:</p>
<p style="margin-left:9%; margin-top: 1em">file
−−−&gt; uudecode −−−&gt;
uncompress −−−&gt; parser <br/>
filter filter</p>
<p style="margin-left:9%; margin-top: 1em">Data flows
through filters in the same order they appear in the source
file. The uudecode filter appeared before the uncompress
filter, so the source file will be uudecoded before it's
uncompressed.</p>
<h2>WRITING A SOURCE FILTER
<a name="WRITING A SOURCE FILTER"></a>
</h2>
<p style="margin-left:9%; margin-top: 1em">There are three
ways to write your own source filter. You can write it in C,
use an external program as a filter, or write the filter in
Perl. I won't cover the first two in any great detail, so
I'll get them out of the way first. Writing the filter in
Perl is most convenient, so I'll devote the most space to
it.</p>
<h2>WRITING A SOURCE FILTER IN C
<a name="WRITING A SOURCE FILTER IN C"></a>
</h2>
<p style="margin-left:9%; margin-top: 1em">The first of the
three available techniques is to write the filter completely
in C. The external module you create interfaces directly
with the source filter hooks provided by Perl.</p>
<p style="margin-left:9%; margin-top: 1em">The advantage of
this technique is that you have complete control over the
implementation of your filter. The big disadvantage is the
increased complexity required to write the filter −
not only do you need to understand the source filter hooks,
but you also need a reasonable knowledge of Perl guts. One
of the few times it is worth going to this trouble is when
writing a source scrambler. The "decrypt" filter
(which unscrambles the source before Perl parses it)
included with the source filter distribution is an example
of a C source filter (see Decryption Filters, below).
<b><br/>
Decryption Filters</b></p>
<p style="margin-left:15%;">All decryption filters work on
the principle of "security through obscurity."
Regardless of how well you write a decryption filter and how
strong your encryption algorithm is, anyone determined
enough can retrieve the original source code. The reason is
quite simple − once the decryption filter has
decrypted the source back to its original form, fragments of
it will be stored in the computer's memory as Perl parses
it. The source might only be in memory for a short period of
time, but anyone possessing a debugger, skill, and lots of
patience can eventually reconstruct your program.</p>
<p style="margin-left:15%; margin-top: 1em">That said,
there are a number of steps that can be taken to make life
difficult for the potential cracker. The most important:
Write your decryption filter in C and statically link the
decryption module into the Perl binary. For further tips to
make life difficult for the potential cracker, see the file
<i>decrypt.pm</i> in the source filters distribution.</p>
<h2>CREATING A SOURCE FILTER AS A SEPARATE EXECUTABLE
<a name="CREATING A SOURCE FILTER AS A SEPARATE EXECUTABLE"></a>
</h2>
<p style="margin-left:9%; margin-top: 1em">An alternative
to writing the filter in C is to create a separate
executable in the language of your choice. The separate
executable reads from standard input, does whatever
processing is necessary, and writes the filtered data to
standard output. "Filter::cpp" is an example of a
source filter implemented as a separate executable −
the executable is the C preprocessor bundled with your C
compiler.</p>
<p style="margin-left:9%; margin-top: 1em">The source
filter distribution includes two modules that simplify this
task: "Filter::exec" and "Filter::sh".
Both allow you to run any external executable. Both use a
coprocess to control the flow of data into and out of the
external executable. (For details on coprocesses, see
Stephens, W.R., "Advanced Programming in the UNIX
Environment." Addison−Wesley, ISBN
0−210−56317−7, pages 441−445.) The
difference between them is that "Filter::exec"
spawns the external command directly, while
"Filter::sh" spawns a shell to execute the
external command. (Unix uses the Bourne shell; NT uses the
cmd shell.) Spawning a shell allows you to make use of the
shell metacharacters and redirection facilities.</p>
<p style="margin-left:9%; margin-top: 1em">Here is an
example script that uses "Filter::sh":</p>
<p style="margin-left:9%; margin-top: 1em">use Filter::sh
'tr XYZ PQR'; <br/>
$a = 1; <br/>
print "XYZ a = $a\n";</p>
<p style="margin-left:9%; margin-top: 1em">The output
you'll get when the script is executed:</p>
<p style="margin-left:9%; margin-top: 1em">PQR a = 1</p>
<p style="margin-left:9%; margin-top: 1em">Writing a source
filter as a separate executable works fine, but a small
performance penalty is incurred. For example, if you execute
the small example above, a separate subprocess will be
created to run the Unix "tr" command. Each use of
the filter requires its own subprocess. If creating
subprocesses is expensive on your system, you might want to
consider one of the other options for creating source
filters.</p>
<h2>WRITING A SOURCE FILTER IN PERL
<a name="WRITING A SOURCE FILTER IN PERL"></a>
</h2>
<p style="margin-left:9%; margin-top: 1em">The easiest and
most portable option available for creating your own source
filter is to write it completely in Perl. To distinguish
this from the previous two techniques, I'll call it a Perl
source filter.</p>
<p style="margin-left:9%; margin-top: 1em">To help
understand how to write a Perl source filter we need an
example to study. Here is a complete source filter that
performs rot13 decoding. (Rot13 is a very simple encryption
scheme used in Usenet postings to hide the contents of
offensive posts. It moves every letter forward thirteen
places, so that A becomes N, B becomes O, and Z becomes
M.)</p>
<p style="margin-left:9%; margin-top: 1em">package Rot13;
<br/>
use Filter::Util::Call; <br/>
sub import { <br/>
my ($type) = @_; <br/>
my ($ref) = []; <br/>
filter_add(bless $ref); <br/>
} <br/>
sub filter { <br/>
my ($self) = @_; <br/>
my ($status); <br/>
tr/n−za−mN−ZA−M/a−zA−Z/
<br/>
if ($status = filter_read()) &gt; 0; <br/>
$status; <br/>
} <br/>
1;</p>
<p style="margin-left:9%; margin-top: 1em">All Perl source
filters are implemented as Perl classes and have the same
basic structure as the example above.</p>
<p style="margin-left:9%; margin-top: 1em">First, we
include the "Filter::Util::Call" module, which
exports a number of functions into your filter's namespace.
The filter shown above uses two of these functions,
filter_add() and filter_read().</p>
<p style="margin-left:9%; margin-top: 1em">Next, we create
the filter object and associate it with the source stream by
defining the "import" function. If you know Perl
well enough, you know that "import" is called
automatically every time a module is included with a use
statement. This makes "import" the ideal place to
both create and install a filter object.</p>
<p style="margin-left:9%; margin-top: 1em">In the example
filter, the object ($ref) is blessed just like any other
Perl object. Our example uses an anonymous array, but this
isn't a requirement. Because this example doesn't need to
store any context information, we could have used a scalar
or hash reference just as well. The next section
demonstrates context data.</p>
<p style="margin-left:9%; margin-top: 1em">The association
between the filter object and the source stream is made with
the filter_add() function. This takes a filter object as a
parameter ($ref in this case) and installs it in the source
stream.</p>
<p style="margin-left:9%; margin-top: 1em">Finally, there
is the code that actually does the filtering. For this type
of Perl source filter, all the filtering is done in a method
called filter(). (It is also possible to write a Perl source
filter using a closure. See the Filter::Util::Call manual
page for more details.) It's called every time the Perl
parser needs another line of source to process. The filter()
method, in turn, reads lines from the source stream using
the filter_read() function.</p>
<p style="margin-left:9%; margin-top: 1em">If a line was
available from the source stream, filter_read() returns a
status value greater than zero and appends the line to $_. A
status value of zero indicates end−of−file, less
than zero means an error. The filter function itself is
expected to return its status in the same way, and put the
filtered line it wants written to the source stream in $_.
The use of $_ accounts for the brevity of most Perl source
filters.</p>
<p style="margin-left:9%; margin-top: 1em">In order to make
use of the rot13 filter we need some way of encoding the
source file in rot13 format. The script below,
"mkrot13", does just that.</p>
<p style="margin-left:9%; margin-top: 1em">die "usage
mkrot13 filename\n" unless @ARGV; <br/>
my $in = $ARGV[0]; <br/>
my $out = "$in.tmp"; <br/>
open(IN, "&lt;$in") or die "Cannot open file
$in: $!\n"; <br/>
open(OUT, "&gt;$out") or die "Cannot open
file $out: $!\n"; <br/>
print OUT "use Rot13;\n"; <br/>
while (&lt;IN&gt;) { <br/>

tr/a−zA−Z/n−za−mN−ZA−M/;
<br/>
print OUT; <br/>
} <br/>
close IN; <br/>
close OUT; <br/>
unlink $in; <br/>
rename $out, $in;</p>
<p style="margin-left:9%; margin-top: 1em">If we encrypt
this with "mkrot13":</p>
<p style="margin-left:9%; margin-top: 1em">print "
hello fred \n";</p>
<p style="margin-left:9%; margin-top: 1em">the result will
be this:</p>
<p style="margin-left:9%; margin-top: 1em">use Rot13; <br/>
cevag "uryyb serq\a";</p>
<p style="margin-left:9%; margin-top: 1em">Running it
produces this output:</p>
<p style="margin-left:9%; margin-top: 1em">hello fred</p>

example was a trivial example. Here's another demonstration
that shows off a few more features.</p>
<p style="margin-left:9%; margin-top: 1em">Say you wanted
to include a lot of debugging code in your Perl script
during development, but you didn't want it available in the
released product. Source filters offer a solution. In order
to keep the example simple, let's say you wanted the
debugging output to be controlled by an environment
variable, "DEBUG". Debugging code is enabled if
the variable exists, otherwise it is disabled.</p>
<p style="margin-left:9%; margin-top: 1em">Two special
marker lines will bracket debugging code, like this:</p>
<p style="margin-left:9%; margin-top: 1em">## DEBUG_BEGIN
<br/>
if ($year &gt; 1999) { <br/>
warn "Debug: millennium bug in year $year\n"; <br/>
} <br/>
## DEBUG_END</p>
<p style="margin-left:9%; margin-top: 1em">The filter
ensures that Perl parses the code between the
&lt;DEBUG_BEGIN&gt; and "DEBUG_END" markers only
when the "DEBUG" environment variable exists. That
means that when "DEBUG" does exist, the code above
should be passed through the filter unchanged. The marker
lines can also be passed through as−is, because the
Perl parser will see them as comment lines. When
"DEBUG" isn't set, we need a way to disable the
debug code. A simple way to achieve that is to convert the
lines between the two markers into comments:</p>
<p style="margin-left:9%; margin-top: 1em">## DEBUG_BEGIN
<br/>
#if ($year &gt; 1999) { <br/>
# warn "Debug: millennium bug in year $year\n";
<br/>
#} <br/>
## DEBUG_END</p>
<p style="margin-left:9%; margin-top: 1em">Here is the
complete Debug filter:</p>
<p style="margin-left:9%; margin-top: 1em">package Debug;
<br/>
use strict; <br/>
use warnings; <br/>
use Filter::Util::Call; <br/>
use constant TRUE =&gt; 1; <br/>
use constant FALSE =&gt; 0; <br/>
sub import { <br/>
my ($type) = @_; <br/>
my (%context) = ( <br/>
Enabled =&gt; defined $ENV{DEBUG}, <br/>
InTraceBlock =&gt; FALSE, <br/>
Filename =&gt; (caller)[1], <br/>
LineNo =&gt; 0, <br/>
LastBegin =&gt; 0, <br/>
); <br/>
filter_add(bless \%context); <br/>
} <br/>
sub Die { <br/>
my ($self) = shift; <br/>
my ($message) = shift; <br/>
my ($line_no) = shift || $self−&gt;{LastBegin}; <br/>
die "$message at $self−&gt;{Filename} line
$line_no.\n" <br/>
} <br/>
sub filter { <br/>
my ($self) = @_; <br/>
my ($status); <br/>
$status = filter_read(); <br/>
++ $self−&gt;{LineNo}; <br/>
# deal with EOF/error first <br/>
if ($status &lt;= 0) { <br/>
$self−&gt;Die("DEBUG_BEGIN has no
DEBUG_END") <br/>
if $self−&gt;{InTraceBlock}; <br/>
return $status; <br/>
} <br/>
if ($self−&gt;{InTraceBlock}) { <br/>
if (/ˆ\s*##\s*DEBUG_BEGIN/ ) { <br/>
$self−&gt;Die("Nested DEBUG_BEGIN",
$self−&gt;{LineNo}) <br/>
} elsif (/ˆ\s*##\s*DEBUG_END/) { <br/>
$self−&gt;{InTraceBlock} = FALSE; <br/>
} <br/>
# comment out the debug lines when the filter is disabled
<br/>
s/ˆ/#/ if ! $self−&gt;{Enabled}; <br/>
} elsif ( /ˆ\s*##\s*DEBUG_BEGIN/ ) { <br/>
$self−&gt;{InTraceBlock} = TRUE; <br/>
$self−&gt;{LastBegin} = $self−&gt;{LineNo}; <br/>
} elsif ( /ˆ\s*##\s*DEBUG_END/ ) { <br/>
$self−&gt;Die("DEBUG_END has no
DEBUG_BEGIN", $self−&gt;{LineNo}); <br/>
} <br/>
return $status; <br/>
} <br/>
1;</p>
<p style="margin-left:9%; margin-top: 1em">The big
difference between this filter and the previous example is
the use of context data in the filter object. The filter
object is based on a hash reference, and is used to keep
various pieces of context information between calls to the
filter function. All but two of the hash fields are used for
error reporting. The first of those two, Enabled, is used by
the filter to determine whether the debugging code should be
given to the Perl parser. The second, InTraceBlock, is true
when the filter has encountered a "DEBUG_BEGIN"
line, but has not yet encountered the following
"DEBUG_END" line.</p>
<p style="margin-left:9%; margin-top: 1em">If you ignore
all the error checking that most of the code does, the
essence of the filter is as follows:</p>
<p style="margin-left:9%; margin-top: 1em">sub filter {
<br/>
my ($self) = @_; <br/>
my ($status); <br/>
$status = filter_read(); <br/>
# deal with EOF/error first <br/>
return $status if $status &lt;= 0; <br/>
if ($self−&gt;{InTraceBlock}) { <br/>
if (/ˆ\s*##\s*DEBUG_END/) { <br/>
$self−&gt;{InTraceBlock} = FALSE <br/>
} <br/>
# comment out debug lines when the filter is disabled <br/>
s/ˆ/#/ if ! $self−&gt;{Enabled}; <br/>
} elsif ( /ˆ\s*##\s*DEBUG_BEGIN/ ) { <br/>
$self−&gt;{InTraceBlock} = TRUE; <br/>
} <br/>
return $status; <br/>
}</p>
<p style="margin-left:9%; margin-top: 1em">Be warned: just
as the C−preprocessor doesn't know C, the Debug filter
doesn't know Perl. It can be fooled quite easily:</p>
<p style="margin-left:9%; margin-top: 1em">print
&lt;&lt;EOM; <br/>
##DEBUG_BEGIN <br/>
EOM</p>
<p style="margin-left:9%; margin-top: 1em">Such things
aside, you can see that a lot can be achieved with a modest
amount of code.</p>
<h2>CONCLUSION
<a name="CONCLUSION"></a>
</h2>
<p style="margin-left:9%; margin-top: 1em">You now have
better understanding of what a source filter is, and you
might even have a possible use for them. If you feel like
playing with source filters but need a bit of inspiration,
here are some extra features you could add to the Debug
filter.</p>
<p style="margin-left:9%; margin-top: 1em">First, an easy
one. Rather than having debugging code that is
all−or−nothing, it would be much more useful to
be able to control which specific blocks of debugging code
get included. Try extending the syntax for debug blocks to
allow each to be identified. The contents of the
"DEBUG" environment variable can then be used to
control which blocks get included.</p>
<p style="margin-left:9%; margin-top: 1em">Once you can
identify individual blocks, try allowing them to be nested.
That isn't difficult either.</p>
<p style="margin-left:9%; margin-top: 1em">Here is an
interesting idea that doesn't involve the Debug filter.
Currently Perl subroutines have fairly limited support for
formal parameter lists. You can specify the number of
parameters and their type, but you still have to manually
take them out of the @_ array yourself. Write a source
filter that allows you to have a named parameter list. Such
a filter would turn this:</p>
<p style="margin-left:9%; margin-top: 1em">sub MySub
($first, $second, @rest) { ... }</p>
<p style="margin-left:9%; margin-top: 1em">into this:</p>
<p style="margin-left:9%; margin-top: 1em">sub MySub($$@) {
<br/>
my ($first) = shift; <br/>
my ($second) = shift; <br/>
my (@rest) = @_; <br/>
... <br/>
}</p>
<p style="margin-left:9%; margin-top: 1em">Finally, if you
feel like a real challenge, have a go at writing a
full−blown Perl macro preprocessor as a source filter.
Borrow the useful features from the C preprocessor and any
other macro processors you know. The tricky bit will be
choosing how much knowledge of Perl's syntax you want your
filter to have.</p>
<h2>LIMITATIONS
<a name="LIMITATIONS"></a>
</h2>
<p style="margin-left:9%; margin-top: 1em">Source filters
only work on the string level, thus are highly limited in
its ability to change source code on the fly. It cannot
detect comments, quoted strings, heredocs, it is no
replacement for a real parser. The only stable usage for
source filters are encryption, compression, or the
byteloader, to translate binary code back to source
code.</p>
<p style="margin-left:9%; margin-top: 1em">See for example
the limitations in Switch, which uses source filters, and
thus is does not work inside a string eval, the presence of
regexes with embedded newlines that are specified with raw
"/.../" delimiters and don't have a modifier
"//x" are indistinguishable from code chunks
beginning with the division operator "/". As a
workaround you must use "m/.../" or
"m?...?" for such patterns. Also, the presence of
regexes specified with raw "?...?" delimiters may
cause mysterious errors. The workaround is to use
"m?...?" instead. See
&lt;https://metacpan.org/pod/Switch#LIMITATIONS&gt;.</p>
<p style="margin-left:9%; margin-top: 1em">Currently the
content of the "__DATA__" block is not
filtered.</p>
<p style="margin-left:9%; margin-top: 1em">Currently
internal buffer lengths are limited to 32−bit
only.</p>
<h2>THINGS TO LOOK OUT FOR
<a name="THINGS TO LOOK OUT FOR"></a>
</h2>
<p style="margin-left:9%; margin-top: 1em">Some Filters
Clobber the "DATA" Handle</p>
<p style="margin-left:15%;">Some source filters use the
"DATA" handle to read the calling program. When
using these source filters you cannot rely on this handle,
nor expect any particular kind of behavior when operating on
it. Filters based on Filter::Util::Call (and therefore
Filter::Simple) do not alter the "DATA"
filehandle, but on the other hand totally ignore the text
after "__DATA__".</p>
<h2>REQUIREMENTS
