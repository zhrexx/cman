<h2>NAME
<a name="NAME"></a>
</h2>
<p style="margin-left:9%; margin-top: 1em">PCRE2 -
Perl-compatible regular expressions (revised API)</p>
<h2>BUILDING PCRE2
<a name="BUILDING PCRE2"></a>
</h2>
<p style="margin-left:9%; margin-top: 1em">PCRE2 is
distributed with a <b>configure</b> script that can be used
to build the library in Unix-like environments using the
applications known as Autotools. Also in the distribution
are files to support building using <b>CMake</b> instead of
<b>configure</b>. The text file <b>README</b> contains
general information about building with Autotools (some of
which is repeated below), and also has some comments about
building on various operating systems. The files in the
<b>vms</b> directory support building under OpenVMS. There
is a lot more information about building PCRE2 without using
Autotools (including information about using <b>CMake</b>
and building "by hand") in the text file called
<b>NON-AUTOTOOLS-BUILD</b>. You should consult this file as
well as the <b>README</b> file if you are building in a
non-Unix-like environment.</p>
<h2>PCRE2 BUILD-TIME OPTIONS
<a name="PCRE2 BUILD-TIME OPTIONS"></a>
</h2>
<p style="margin-left:9%; margin-top: 1em">The rest of this
document describes the optional features of PCRE2 that can
be selected when the library is compiled. It assumes use of
the <b>configure</b> script, where the optional features are
selected or deselected by providing options to
<b>configure</b> before running the <b>make</b> command.
However, the same options can be selected in both Unix-like
and non-Unix-like environments if you are using <b>CMake</b>
instead of <b>configure</b> to build PCRE2.</p>
<p style="margin-left:9%; margin-top: 1em">If you are not
using Autotools or <b>CMake</b>, option selection can be
done by editing the <b>config.h</b> file, or by passing
parameter settings to the compiler, as described in
<b>NON-AUTOTOOLS-BUILD</b>.</p>
<p style="margin-left:9%; margin-top: 1em">The complete
list of options for <b>configure</b> (which includes the
standard ones such as the selection of the installation
directory) can be obtained by running</p>
<p style="margin-left:9%; margin-top: 1em">./configure
--help</p>
<p style="margin-left:9%; margin-top: 1em">The following
sections include descriptions of "on/off" options
whose names begin with --enable or --disable. Because of the
way that <b>configure</b> works, --enable and --disable
always come in pairs, so the complementary option always
exists as well, but as it specifies the default, it is not
described. Options that specify values have names that start
with --with. At the end of a <b>configure</b> run, a summary
of the configuration is output.</p>
<h2>BUILDING 8-BIT, 16-BIT AND 32-BIT LIBRARIES
<a name="BUILDING 8-BIT, 16-BIT AND 32-BIT LIBRARIES"></a>
</h2>
<p style="margin-left:9%; margin-top: 1em">By default, a
library called <b>libpcre2-8</b> is built, containing
functions that take string arguments contained in arrays of
bytes, interpreted either as single-byte characters, or
UTF-8 strings. You can also build two other libraries,
called <b>libpcre2-16</b> and <b>libpcre2-32</b>, which
process strings that are contained in arrays of 16-bit and
32-bit code units, respectively. These can be interpreted
either as single-unit characters or UTF-16/UTF-32 strings.
To build these additional libraries, add one or both of the
following to the <b>configure</b> command:</p>
<p style="margin-left:9%; margin-top: 1em">--enable-pcre2-16
<br/>
--enable-pcre2-32</p>
<p style="margin-left:9%; margin-top: 1em">If you do not
want the 8-bit library, add</p>
<p style="margin-left:9%; margin-top: 1em">--disable-pcre2-8</p>
<p style="margin-left:9%; margin-top: 1em">as well. At
least one of the three libraries must be built. Note that
the POSIX wrapper is for the 8-bit library only, and that
<b>pcre2grep</b> is an 8-bit program. Neither of these are
built if you select only the 16-bit or 32-bit libraries.</p>
<h2>BUILDING SHARED AND STATIC LIBRARIES
<a name="BUILDING SHARED AND STATIC LIBRARIES"></a>
</h2>
<p style="margin-left:9%; margin-top: 1em">The Autotools
PCRE2 building process uses <b>libtool</b> to build both
shared and static libraries by default. You can suppress an
unwanted library by adding one of</p>
<p style="margin-left:9%; margin-top: 1em">--disable-shared
<br/>
--disable-static</p>
<p style="margin-left:9%; margin-top: 1em">to the
<b>configure</b> command. Setting --disable-shared ensures
that PCRE2 libraries are built as static libraries. The
binaries that are then created as part of the build process
(for example, <b>pcre2test</b> and <b>pcre2grep</b>) are
linked statically with one or more PCRE2 libraries, but may
also be dynamically linked with other libraries such as
<b>libc</b>. If you want these binaries to be fully
statically linked, you can set LDFLAGS like this:</p>
<p style="margin-left:9%; margin-top: 1em">LDFLAGS=--static
./configure --disable-shared</p>
<p style="margin-left:9%; margin-top: 1em">Note the two
hyphens in --static. Of course, this works only if static
versions of all the relevant libraries are available for
linking.</p>
<h2>UNICODE AND UTF SUPPORT
<a name="UNICODE AND UTF SUPPORT"></a>
</h2>
<p style="margin-left:9%; margin-top: 1em">By default,
PCRE2 is built with support for Unicode and UTF character
strings. To build it without Unicode support, add</p>
<p style="margin-left:9%; margin-top: 1em">--disable-unicode</p>
<p style="margin-left:9%; margin-top: 1em">to the
<b>configure</b> command. This setting applies to all three
libraries. It is not possible to build one library with
Unicode support and another without in the same
configuration.</p>
<p style="margin-left:9%; margin-top: 1em">Of itself,
Unicode support does not make PCRE2 treat strings as UTF-8,
UTF-16 or UTF-32. To do that, applications that use the
library can set the PCRE2_UTF option when they call
<b>pcre2_compile()</b> to compile a pattern. Alternatively,
patterns may be started with (*UTF) unless the application
has locked this out by setting PCRE2_NEVER_UTF.</p>
<p style="margin-left:9%; margin-top: 1em">UTF support
allows the libraries to process character code points up to
0x10ffff in the strings that they handle. Unicode support
also gives access to the Unicode properties of characters,
using pattern escapes such as \P, \p, and \X. Only the
general category properties such as <i>Lu</i> and <i>Nd</i>,
script names, and some bi-directional properties are
supported. Details are given in the <b>pcre2pattern</b>
documentation.</p>
<p style="margin-left:9%; margin-top: 1em">Pattern escapes
such as \d and \w do not by default make use of Unicode
properties. The application can request that they do by
setting the PCRE2_UCP option. Unless the application has set
PCRE2_NEVER_UCP, a pattern may also request this by starting
with (*UCP).</p>
<h2>DISABLING THE USE OF \C
<a name="DISABLING THE USE OF \C"></a>
</h2>
<p style="margin-left:9%; margin-top: 1em">The \C escape
sequence, which matches a single code unit, even in a UTF
mode, can cause unpredictable behaviour because it may leave
the current matching point in the middle of a
multi-code-unit character. The application can lock it out
by setting the PCRE2_NEVER_BACKSLASH_C option when calling
<b>pcre2_compile()</b>. There is also a build-time
option</p>
<p style="margin-left:9%; margin-top: 1em">--enable-never-backslash-C</p>
<p style="margin-left:9%; margin-top: 1em">(note the upper
case C) which locks out the use of \C entirely.</p>
<h2>JUST-IN-TIME COMPILER SUPPORT
<a name="JUST-IN-TIME COMPILER SUPPORT"></a>
</h2>
<p style="margin-left:9%; margin-top: 1em">Just-in-time
(JIT) compiler support is included in the build by
specifying</p>
<p style="margin-left:9%; margin-top: 1em">--enable-jit</p>
<p style="margin-left:9%; margin-top: 1em">This support is
available only for certain hardware architectures. If this
option is set for an unsupported architecture, a building
error occurs. If in doubt, use</p>
<p style="margin-left:9%; margin-top: 1em">--enable-jit=auto</p>
<p style="margin-left:9%; margin-top: 1em">which enables
JIT only if the current hardware is supported. You can check
if JIT is enabled in the configuration summary that is
output at the end of a <b>configure</b> run. If you are
enabling JIT under SELinux you may also want to add</p>
<p style="margin-left:9%; margin-top: 1em">--enable-jit-sealloc</p>
<p style="margin-left:9%; margin-top: 1em">which enables
the use of an execmem allocator in JIT that is compatible
with SELinux. This has no effect if JIT is not enabled. See
the <b>pcre2jit</b> documentation for a discussion of JIT
usage. When JIT support is enabled, <b>pcre2grep</b>
automatically makes use of it, unless you add</p>
<p style="margin-left:9%; margin-top: 1em">--disable-pcre2grep-jit</p>
<p style="margin-left:9%; margin-top: 1em">to the
<b>configure</b> command.</p>
<h2>NEWLINE RECOGNITION
<a name="NEWLINE RECOGNITION"></a>
</h2>
<p style="margin-left:9%; margin-top: 1em">By default,
PCRE2 interprets the linefeed (LF) character as indicating
the end of a line. This is the normal newline character on
Unix-like systems. You can compile PCRE2 to use carriage
return (CR) instead, by adding</p>
<p style="margin-left:9%; margin-top: 1em">--enable-newline-is-cr</p>
<p style="margin-left:9%; margin-top: 1em">to the
<b>configure</b> command. There is also an
--enable-newline-is-lf option, which explicitly specifies
linefeed as the newline character.</p>
<p style="margin-left:9%; margin-top: 1em">Alternatively,
you can specify that line endings are to be indicated by the
two-character sequence CRLF (CR immediately followed by LF).
If you want this, add</p>
<p style="margin-left:9%; margin-top: 1em">--enable-newline-is-crlf</p>
<p style="margin-left:9%; margin-top: 1em">to the
<b>configure</b> command. There is a fourth option,
specified by</p>
<p style="margin-left:9%; margin-top: 1em">--enable-newline-is-anycrlf</p>
<p style="margin-left:9%; margin-top: 1em">which causes
PCRE2 to recognize any of the three sequences CR, LF, or
CRLF as indicating a line ending. A fifth option, specified
by</p>
<p style="margin-left:9%; margin-top: 1em">--enable-newline-is-any</p>
<p style="margin-left:9%; margin-top: 1em">causes PCRE2 to
recognize any Unicode newline sequence. The Unicode newline
sequences are the three just mentioned, plus the single
characters VT (vertical tab, U+000B), FF (form feed,
U+000C), NEL (next line, U+0085), LS (line separator,
U+2028), and PS (paragraph separator, U+2029). The final
option is</p>
<p style="margin-left:9%; margin-top: 1em">--enable-newline-is-nul</p>
<p style="margin-left:9%; margin-top: 1em">which causes NUL
(binary zero) to be set as the default line-ending
character.</p>
<p style="margin-left:9%; margin-top: 1em">Whatever default
line ending convention is selected when PCRE2 is built can
be overridden by applications that use the library. At build
time it is recommended to use the standard for your
operating system.</p>
<h2>WHAT \R MATCHES
<a name="WHAT \R MATCHES"></a>
</h2>
<p style="margin-left:9%; margin-top: 1em">By default, the
sequence \R in a pattern matches any Unicode newline
sequence, independently of what has been selected as the
line ending sequence. If you specify</p>
<p style="margin-left:9%; margin-top: 1em">--enable-bsr-anycrlf</p>
<p style="margin-left:9%; margin-top: 1em">the default is
changed so that \R matches only CR, LF, or CRLF. Whatever is
selected when PCRE2 is built can be overridden by
applications that use the library.</p>
<h2>HANDLING VERY LARGE PATTERNS
<a name="HANDLING VERY LARGE PATTERNS"></a>
</h2>
<p style="margin-left:9%; margin-top: 1em">Within a
compiled pattern, offset values are used to point from one
part to another (for example, from an opening parenthesis to
an alternation metacharacter). By default, in the 8-bit and
16-bit libraries, two-byte values are used for these
offsets, leading to a maximum size for a compiled pattern of
around 64 thousand code units. This is sufficient to handle
all but the most gigantic patterns. Nevertheless, some
people do want to process truly enormous patterns, so it is
possible to compile PCRE2 to use three-byte or four-byte
offsets by adding a setting such as</p>
<p style="margin-left:9%; margin-top: 1em">--with-link-size=3</p>
<p style="margin-left:9%; margin-top: 1em">to the
<b>configure</b> command. The value given must be 2, 3, or
4. For the 16-bit library, a value of 3 is rounded up to 4.
In these libraries, using longer offsets slows down the
operation of PCRE2 because it has to load additional data
when handling them. For the 32-bit library the value is
always 4 and cannot be overridden; the value of
--with-link-size is ignored.</p>
<h2>LIMITING PCRE2 RESOURCE USAGE
<a name="LIMITING PCRE2 RESOURCE USAGE"></a>
</h2>
<p style="margin-left:9%; margin-top: 1em">The
<b>pcre2_match()</b> function increments a counter each time
it goes round its main loop. Putting a limit on this counter
controls the amount of computing resource used by a single
call to <b>pcre2_match()</b>. The limit can be changed at
run time, as described in the <b>pcre2api</b> documentation.
The default is 10 million, but this can be changed by adding
a setting such as</p>
<p style="margin-left:9%; margin-top: 1em">--with-match-limit=500000</p>
<p style="margin-left:9%; margin-top: 1em">to the
<b>configure</b> command. This setting also applies to the
<b>pcre2_dfa_match()</b> matching function, and to JIT
matching (though the counting is done differently).</p>
<p style="margin-left:9%; margin-top: 1em">The
<b>pcre2_match()</b> function uses heap memory to record
backtracking points. The more nested backtracking points
there are (that is, the deeper the search tree), the more
memory is needed. There is an upper limit, specified in
kibibytes (units of 1024 bytes). This limit can be changed
at run time, as described in the <b>pcre2api</b>
documentation. The default limit (in effect unlimited) is 20
million. You can change this by a setting such as</p>
<p style="margin-left:9%; margin-top: 1em">--with-heap-limit=500</p>
<p style="margin-left:9%; margin-top: 1em">which limits the
amount of heap to 500 KiB. This limit applies only to
interpretive matching in <b>pcre2_match()</b> and
<b>pcre2_dfa_match()</b>, which may also use the heap for
internal workspace when processing complicated patterns.
This limit does not apply when JIT (which has its own memory
arrangements) is used.</p>
<p style="margin-left:9%; margin-top: 1em">You can also
explicitly limit the depth of nested backtracking in the
<b>pcre2_match()</b> interpreter. This limit defaults to the
value that is set for --with-match-limit. You can set a
lower default limit by adding, for example,</p>
<p style="margin-left:9%; margin-top: 1em">--with-match-limit-depth=10000</p>
<p style="margin-left:9%; margin-top: 1em">to the
<b>configure</b> command. This value can be overridden at
run time. This depth limit indirectly limits the amount of
heap memory that is used, but because the size of each
backtracking "frame" depends on the number of
capturing parentheses in a pattern, the amount of heap that
is used before the limit is reached varies from pattern to
pattern. This limit was more useful in versions before
10.30, where function recursion was used for
backtracking.</p>
<p style="margin-left:9%; margin-top: 1em">As well as
applying to <b>pcre2_match()</b>, the depth limit also
controls the depth of recursive function calls in
<b>pcre2_dfa_match()</b>. These are used for lookaround
assertions, atomic groups, and recursion within patterns.
The limit does not apply to JIT matching.</p>
<h2>LIMITING VARIABLE-LENGTH LOOKBEHIND ASSERTIONS
<a name="LIMITING VARIABLE-LENGTH LOOKBEHIND ASSERTIONS"></a>
</h2>
<p style="margin-left:9%; margin-top: 1em">Lookbehind
assertions in which one or more branches can match a
variable number of characters are supported only if there is
a maximum matching length for each top-level branch. There
is a limit to this maximum that defaults to 255 characters.
You can alter this default by a setting such as</p>
<p style="margin-left:9%; margin-top: 1em">--with-max-varlookbehind=100</p>
<p style="margin-left:9%; margin-top: 1em">The limit can be
changed at runtime by calling
<b>pcre2_set_max_varlookbehind()</b>. Lookbehind assertions
in which every branch matches a fixed number of characters
(not necessarily all the same) are not constrained by this
limit.</p>
<h2>CREATING CHARACTER TABLES AT BUILD TIME
<a name="CREATING CHARACTER TABLES AT BUILD TIME"></a>
</h2>
<p style="margin-left:9%; margin-top: 1em">PCRE2 uses fixed
tables for processing characters whose code points are less
than 256. By default, PCRE2 is built with a set of tables
that are distributed in the file
<i>src/pcre2_chartables.c.dist</i>. These tables are for
ASCII codes only. If you add</p>
<p style="margin-left:9%; margin-top: 1em">--enable-rebuild-chartables</p>
<p style="margin-left:9%; margin-top: 1em">to the
<b>configure</b> command, the distributed tables are no
longer used. Instead, a program called <b>pcre2_dftables</b>
is compiled and run. This outputs the source for new set of
tables, created in the default locale of your C run-time
system. This method of replacing the tables does not work if
you are cross compiling, because <b>pcre2_dftables</b> needs
to be run on the local host and therefore not compiled with
the cross compiler.</p>
<p style="margin-left:9%; margin-top: 1em">If you need to
create alternative tables when cross compiling, you will
have to do so "by hand". There may also be other
reasons for creating tables manually. To cause
<b>pcre2_dftables</b> to be built on the local host, run a
normal compiling command, and then run the program with the
output file as its argument, for example:</p>
<p style="margin-left:9%; margin-top: 1em">cc
src/pcre2_dftables.c -o pcre2_dftables <br/>
./pcre2_dftables src/pcre2_chartables.c</p>
<p style="margin-left:9%; margin-top: 1em">This builds the
tables in the default locale of the local host. If you want
to specify a locale, you must use the -L option:</p>
<p style="margin-left:9%; margin-top: 1em">LC_ALL=fr_FR
./pcre2_dftables -L src/pcre2_chartables.c</p>
<p style="margin-left:9%; margin-top: 1em">You can also
specify -b (with or without -L). This causes the tables to
be written in binary instead of as source code. A set of
binary tables can be loaded into memory by an application
and passed to <b>pcre2_compile()</b> in the same way as
tables created by calling <b>pcre2_maketables()</b>. The
tables are just a string of bytes, independent of hardware
characteristics such as endianness. This means they can be
bundled with an application that runs in different
environments, to ensure consistent behaviour.</p>
<h2>USING EBCDIC CODE
<a name="USING EBCDIC CODE"></a>
</h2>
<p style="margin-left:9%; margin-top: 1em">PCRE2 assumes by
default that it will run in an environment where the
character code is ASCII or Unicode, which is a superset of
ASCII. This is the case for most computer operating systems.
PCRE2 can, however, be compiled to run in an 8-bit EBCDIC
environment by adding</p>
<p style="margin-left:9%; margin-top: 1em">--enable-ebcdic
--disable-unicode</p>
<p style="margin-left:9%; margin-top: 1em">to the
<b>configure</b> command. This setting implies
--enable-rebuild-chartables. You should only use it if you
know that you are in an EBCDIC environment (for example, an
IBM mainframe operating system).</p>
<p style="margin-left:9%; margin-top: 1em">It is not
possible to support both EBCDIC and UTF-8 codes in the same
version of the library. Consequently, --enable-unicode and
--enable-ebcdic are mutually exclusive.</p>
<p style="margin-left:9%; margin-top: 1em">The EBCDIC
character that corresponds to an ASCII LF is assumed to have
the value 0x15 by default. However, in some EBCDIC
environments, 0x25 is used. In such an environment you
should use</p>
<p style="margin-left:9%; margin-top: 1em">--enable-ebcdic-nl25</p>
<p style="margin-left:9%; margin-top: 1em">as well as, or
instead of, --enable-ebcdic. The EBCDIC character for CR has
the same value as in ASCII, namely, 0x0d. Whichever of 0x15
and 0x25 is <i>not</i> chosen as LF is made to correspond to
the Unicode NEL character (which, in Unicode, is 0x85).</p>
<p style="margin-left:9%; margin-top: 1em">The options that
select newline behaviour, such as --enable-newline-is-cr,
and equivalent run-time options, refer to these character
values in an EBCDIC environment.</p>
<h2>PCRE2GREP SUPPORT FOR EXTERNAL SCRIPTS
<a name="PCRE2GREP SUPPORT FOR EXTERNAL SCRIPTS"></a>
</h2>
<p style="margin-left:9%; margin-top: 1em">By default
<b>pcre2grep</b> supports the use of callouts with string
arguments within the patterns it is matching. There are two
kinds: one that generates output using local code, and
another that calls an external program or script. If
--disable-pcre2grep-callout-fork is added to the
<b>configure</b> command, only the first kind of callout is
supported; if --disable-pcre2grep-callout is used, all
callouts are completely ignored. For more details of
<b>pcre2grep</b> callouts, see the <b>pcre2grep</b>
documentation.</p>
<h2>PCRE2GREP OPTIONS FOR COMPRESSED FILE SUPPORT
<a name="PCRE2GREP OPTIONS FOR COMPRESSED FILE SUPPORT"></a>
</h2>
<p style="margin-left:9%; margin-top: 1em">By default,
<b>pcre2grep</b> reads all files as plain text. You can
build it so that it recognizes files whose names end in
<b>.gz</b> or <b>.bz2</b>, and reads them with <b>libz</b>
or <b>libbz2</b>, respectively, by adding one or both of</p>
<p style="margin-left:9%; margin-top: 1em">--enable-pcre2grep-libz
<br/>
--enable-pcre2grep-libbz2</p>
<p style="margin-left:9%; margin-top: 1em">to the
<b>configure</b> command. These options naturally require
that the relevant libraries are installed on your system.
Configuration will fail if they are not.</p>
<h2>PCRE2GREP BUFFER SIZE
<a name="PCRE2GREP BUFFER SIZE"></a>
</h2>
<p style="margin-left:9%; margin-top: 1em"><b>pcre2grep</b>
uses an internal buffer to hold a "window" on the
file it is scanning, in order to be able to output
"before" and "after" lines when it finds
a match. The default starting size of the buffer is 20KiB.
The buffer itself is three times this size, but because of
the way it is used for holding "before" lines, the
longest line that is guaranteed to be processable is the
notional buffer size. If a longer line is encountered,
<b>pcre2grep</b> automatically expands the buffer, up to a
specified maximum size, whose default is 1MiB or the
starting size, whichever is the larger. You can change the
default parameter values by adding, for example,</p>
<p style="margin-left:9%; margin-top: 1em">--with-pcre2grep-bufsize=51200
<br/>
--with-pcre2grep-max-bufsize=2097152</p>
<p style="margin-left:9%; margin-top: 1em">to the
<b>configure</b> command. The caller of <b>pcre2grep</b> can
override these values by using --buffer-size and
--max-buffer-size on the command line.</p>
<h2>PCRE2TEST OPTION FOR LIBREADLINE SUPPORT
<a name="PCRE2TEST OPTION FOR LIBREADLINE SUPPORT"></a>
</h2>
<p style="margin-left:9%; margin-top: 1em">If you add one
of</p>
<p style="margin-left:9%; margin-top: 1em">--enable-pcre2test-libreadline
<br/>
--enable-pcre2test-libedit</p>
<p style="margin-left:9%; margin-top: 1em">to the
<b>configure</b> command, <b>pcre2test</b> is linked with
the <b>libreadline</b> or<b>libedit</b> library,
respectively, and when its input is from a terminal, it
reads it using the <b>readline()</b> function. This provides
line-editing and history facilities. Note that
<b>libreadline</b> is GPL-licensed, so if you distribute a
binary of <b>pcre2test</b> linked in this way, there may be
licensing issues. These can be avoided by linking instead
with <b>libedit</b>, which has a BSD licence.</p>
<p style="margin-left:9%; margin-top: 1em">Setting
--enable-pcre2test-libreadline causes the <b>-lreadline</b>
option to be added to the <b>pcre2test</b> build. In many
operating environments with a system-installed readline
library this is sufficient. However, in some environments
(e.g. if an unmodified distribution version of readline is
in use), some extra configuration may be necessary. The
INSTALL file for <b>libreadline</b> says this:</p>
<p style="margin-left:9%; margin-top: 1em">"Readline
uses the termcap functions, but does not link with <br/>
the termcap or curses library itself, allowing applications
<br/>
which link with readline the to choose an appropriate
library."</p>
<p style="margin-left:9%; margin-top: 1em">If your
environment has not been set up so that an appropriate
library is automatically included, you may need to add
something like</p>
<p style="margin-left:9%; margin-top: 1em">LIBS="-ncurses"</p>
<p style="margin-left:9%; margin-top: 1em">immediately
before the <b>configure</b> command.</p>
<h2>INCLUDING DEBUGGING CODE
<a name="INCLUDING DEBUGGING CODE"></a>
</h2>
<p style="margin-left:9%; margin-top: 1em">If you add</p>
<p style="margin-left:9%; margin-top: 1em">--enable-debug</p>
<p style="margin-left:9%; margin-top: 1em">to the
<b>configure</b> command, additional debugging code is
included in the build. This feature is intended for use by
the PCRE2 maintainers.</p>
<h2>DEBUGGING WITH VALGRIND SUPPORT
<a name="DEBUGGING WITH VALGRIND SUPPORT"></a>
</h2>
<p style="margin-left:9%; margin-top: 1em">If you add</p>
<p style="margin-left:9%; margin-top: 1em">--enable-valgrind</p>
<p style="margin-left:9%; margin-top: 1em">to the
<b>configure</b> command, PCRE2 will use valgrind
annotations to mark certain memory regions as unaddressable.
This allows it to detect invalid memory accesses, and is
mostly useful for debugging PCRE2 itself.</p>
<h2>CODE COVERAGE REPORTING
<a name="CODE COVERAGE REPORTING"></a>
</h2>
<p style="margin-left:9%; margin-top: 1em">If your C
compiler is gcc, you can build a version of PCRE2 that can
generate a code coverage report for its test suite. To
enable this, you must install <b>lcov</b> version 1.6 or
above. Then specify</p>
<p style="margin-left:9%; margin-top: 1em">--enable-coverage</p>
<p style="margin-left:9%; margin-top: 1em">to the
<b>configure</b> command and build PCRE2 in the usual
way.</p>
<p style="margin-left:9%; margin-top: 1em">Note that using
<b>ccache</b> (a caching C compiler) is incompatible with
code coverage reporting. If you have configured
<b>ccache</b> to run automatically on your system, you must
set the environment variable</p>
<p style="margin-left:9%; margin-top: 1em">CCACHE_DISABLE=1</p>
<p style="margin-left:9%; margin-top: 1em">before running
<b>make</b> to build PCRE2, so that <b>ccache</b> is not
used.</p>
<p style="margin-left:9%; margin-top: 1em">When
--enable-coverage is used, the following addition targets
are added to the <i>Makefile</i>:</p>
<p style="margin-left:9%; margin-top: 1em">make
coverage</p>
<p style="margin-left:9%; margin-top: 1em">This creates a
fresh coverage report for the PCRE2 test suite. It is
equivalent to running "make coverage-reset",
"make coverage-baseline", "make check",
and then "make coverage-report".</p>
<p style="margin-left:9%; margin-top: 1em">make
coverage-reset</p>
<p style="margin-left:9%; margin-top: 1em">This zeroes the
coverage counters, but does nothing else.</p>
<p style="margin-left:9%; margin-top: 1em">make
coverage-baseline</p>
<p style="margin-left:9%; margin-top: 1em">This captures
baseline coverage information.</p>
<p style="margin-left:9%; margin-top: 1em">make
coverage-report</p>
<p style="margin-left:9%; margin-top: 1em">This creates the
coverage report.</p>
<p style="margin-left:9%; margin-top: 1em">make
coverage-clean-report</p>
<p style="margin-left:9%; margin-top: 1em">This removes the
generated coverage report without cleaning the coverage data
itself.</p>
<p style="margin-left:9%; margin-top: 1em">make
coverage-clean-data</p>
<p style="margin-left:9%; margin-top: 1em">This removes the
captured coverage data without removing the coverage files
created at compile time (*.gcno).</p>
<p style="margin-left:9%; margin-top: 1em">make
coverage-clean</p>
<p style="margin-left:9%; margin-top: 1em">This cleans all
coverage data including the generated coverage report. For
more information about code coverage, see the <b>gcov</b>
and <b>lcov</b> documentation.</p>
<h2>DISABLING THE Z AND T FORMATTING MODIFIERS
<a name="DISABLING THE Z AND T FORMATTING MODIFIERS"></a>
</h2>
<p style="margin-left:9%; margin-top: 1em">The C99 standard
defines formatting modifiers z and t for size_t and
ptrdiff_t values, respectively. By default, PCRE2 uses these
modifiers in environments other than old versions of
Microsoft Visual Studio when __STDC_VERSION__ is defined and
has a value greater than or equal to 199901L (indicating
support for C99). However, there is at least one environment
that claims to be C99 but does not support these modifiers.
If</p>
<p style="margin-left:9%; margin-top: 1em">--disable-percent-zt</p>
<p style="margin-left:9%; margin-top: 1em">is specified, no
use is made of the z or t modifiers. Instead of %td or %zu,
a suitable format is used depending in the size of long for
the platform.</p>
<h2>SUPPORT FOR FUZZERS
<a name="SUPPORT FOR FUZZERS"></a>
</h2>
<p style="margin-left:9%; margin-top: 1em">There is a
special option for use by people who want to run fuzzing
tests on PCRE2:</p>
<p style="margin-left:9%; margin-top: 1em">--enable-fuzz-support</p>
<p style="margin-left:9%; margin-top: 1em">At present this
applies only to the 8-bit library. If set, it causes an
extra library called libpcre2-fuzzsupport.a to be built, but
not installed. This contains a single function called
LLVMFuzzerTestOneInput() whose arguments are a pointer to a
string and the length of the string. When called, this
function tries to compile the string as a pattern, and if
that succeeds, to match it. This is done both with no
options and with some random options bits that are generated
from the string.</p>
<p style="margin-left:9%; margin-top: 1em">Setting
--enable-fuzz-support also causes a binary called
<b>pcre2fuzzcheck</b> to be created. This is normally run
under valgrind or used when PCRE2 is compiled with address
sanitizing enabled. It calls the fuzzing function and
outputs information about what it is doing. The input
strings are specified by arguments: if an argument starts
with "=" the rest of it is a literal input string.
Otherwise, it is assumed to be a file name, and the contents
of the file are the test string.</p>
<h2>OBSOLETE OPTION
<a name="OBSOLETE OPTION"></a>
</h2>
<p style="margin-left:9%; margin-top: 1em">In versions of
PCRE2 prior to 10.30, there were two ways of handling
backtracking in the <b>pcre2_match()</b> function. The
default was to use the system stack, but if</p>
<p style="margin-left:9%; margin-top: 1em">--disable-stack-for-recursion</p>
<p style="margin-left:9%; margin-top: 1em">was set, memory
on the heap was used. From release 10.30 onwards this has
changed (the stack is no longer used) and this option now
does nothing except give a warning.</p>
