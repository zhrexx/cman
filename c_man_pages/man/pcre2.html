<h2>NAME
<a name="NAME"></a>
</h2>
<p style="margin-left:9%; margin-top: 1em">PCRE2 -
Perl-compatible regular expressions (revised API)</p>
<h2>INTRODUCTION
<a name="INTRODUCTION"></a>
</h2>
<p style="margin-left:9%; margin-top: 1em">PCRE2 is the
name used for a revised API for the PCRE library, which is a
set of functions, written in C, that implement regular
expression pattern matching using the same syntax and
semantics as Perl, with just a few differences. After nearly
two decades, the limitations of the original API were making
development increasingly difficult. The new API is more
extensible, and it was simplified by abolishing the separate
"study" optimizing function; in PCRE2, patterns
are automatically optimized where possible. Since forking
from PCRE1, the code has been extensively refactored and new
features introduced. The old library is now obsolete and is
no longer maintained.</p>
<p style="margin-left:9%; margin-top: 1em">As well as
Perl-style regular expression patterns, some features that
appeared in Python and the original PCRE before they
appeared in Perl are available using the Python syntax.
There is also some support for one or two .NET and Oniguruma
syntax items, and there are options for requesting some
minor changes that give better ECMAScript (aka JavaScript)
compatibility.</p>
<p style="margin-left:9%; margin-top: 1em">The source code
for PCRE2 can be compiled to support strings of 8-bit,
16-bit, or 32-bit code units, which means that up to three
separate libraries may be installed, one for each code unit
size. The size of code unit is not related to the bit size
of the underlying hardware. In a 64-bit environment that
also supports 32-bit applications, versions of PCRE2 that
are compiled in both 64-bit and 32-bit modes may be
needed.</p>
<p style="margin-left:9%; margin-top: 1em">The original
work to extend PCRE to 16-bit and 32-bit code units was done
by Zoltan Herczeg and Christian Persch, respectively. In all
three cases, strings can be interpreted either as one
character per code unit, or as UTF-encoded Unicode, with
support for Unicode general category properties. Unicode
support is optional at build time (but is the default).
However, processing strings as UTF code units must be
enabled explicitly at run time. The version of Unicode in
use can be discovered by running</p>
<p style="margin-left:9%; margin-top: 1em">pcre2test -C</p>
<p style="margin-left:9%; margin-top: 1em">The three
libraries contain identical sets of functions, with names
ending in _8, _16, or _32, respectively (for example,
<b>pcre2_compile_8()</b>). However, by defining
PCRE2_CODE_UNIT_WIDTH to be 8, 16, or 32, a program that
uses just one code unit width can be written using generic
names such as <b>pcre2_compile()</b>, and the documentation
is written assuming that this is the case.</p>
<p style="margin-left:9%; margin-top: 1em">In addition to
the Perl-compatible matching function, PCRE2 contains an
alternative function that matches the same compiled patterns
in a different way. In certain circumstances, the
alternative function has some advantages. For a discussion
of the two matching algorithms, see the <b>pcre2matching</b>
page.</p>
<p style="margin-left:9%; margin-top: 1em">Details of
exactly which Perl regular expression features are and are
not supported by PCRE2 are given in separate documents. See
the <b>pcre2pattern</b> and <b>pcre2compat</b> pages. There
is a syntax summary in the <b>pcre2syntax</b> page.</p>
<p style="margin-left:9%; margin-top: 1em">Some features of
PCRE2 can be included, excluded, or changed when the library
is built. The <b>pcre2_config()</b> function makes it
possible for a client to discover which features are
available. The features themselves are described in the
<b>pcre2build</b> page. Documentation about building PCRE2
for various operating systems can be found in the
<b>README</b> and <b>NON-AUTOTOOLS_BUILD</b> files in the
source distribution.</p>
<p style="margin-left:9%; margin-top: 1em">The libraries
contains a number of undocumented internal functions and
data tables that are used by more than one of the exported
external functions, but which are not intended for use by
external callers. Their names all begin with
"_pcre2", which hopefully will not provoke any
name clashes. In some environments, it is possible to
control which external symbols are exported when a shared
library is built, and in these cases the undocumented
symbols are not exported.</p>
<h2>SECURITY CONSIDERATIONS
<a name="SECURITY CONSIDERATIONS"></a>
</h2>
<p style="margin-left:9%; margin-top: 1em">If you are using
PCRE2 in a non-UTF application that permits users to supply
arbitrary patterns for compilation, you should be aware of a
feature that allows users to turn on UTF support from within
a pattern. For example, an 8-bit pattern that begins with
"(*UTF)" turns on UTF-8 mode, which interprets
patterns and subjects as strings of UTF-8 code units instead
of individual 8-bit characters. This causes both the pattern
and any data against which it is matched to be checked for
UTF-8 validity. If the data string is very long, such a
check might use sufficiently many resources as to cause your
application to lose performance.</p>
<p style="margin-left:9%; margin-top: 1em">One way of
guarding against this possibility is to use the
<b>pcre2_pattern_info()</b> function to check the compiled
pattern’s options for PCRE2_UTF. Alternatively, you
can set the PCRE2_NEVER_UTF option when calling
<b>pcre2_compile()</b>. This causes a compile time error if
the pattern contains a UTF-setting sequence.</p>
<p style="margin-left:9%; margin-top: 1em">The use of
Unicode properties for character types such as \d can also
be enabled from within the pattern, by specifying
"(*UCP)". This feature can be disallowed by
setting the PCRE2_NEVER_UCP option.</p>
<p style="margin-left:9%; margin-top: 1em">If your
application is one that supports UTF, be aware that validity
checking can take time. If the same data string is to be
matched many times, you can use the PCRE2_NO_UTF_CHECK
option for the second and subsequent matches to avoid
running redundant checks.</p>
<p style="margin-left:9%; margin-top: 1em">The use of the
\C escape sequence in a UTF-8 or UTF-16 pattern can lead to
problems, because it may leave the current matching point in
the middle of a multi-code-unit character. The
PCRE2_NEVER_BACKSLASH_C option can be used by an application
to lock out the use of \C, causing a compile-time error if
it is encountered. It is also possible to build PCRE2 with
the use of \C permanently disabled.</p>
<p style="margin-left:9%; margin-top: 1em">Another way that
performance can be hit is by running a pattern that has a
very large search tree against a string that will never
match. Nested unlimited repeats in a pattern are a common
example. PCRE2 provides some protection against this: see
the <b>pcre2_set_match_limit()</b> function in the
<b>pcre2api</b> page. There is a similar function called
<b>pcre2_set_depth_limit()</b> that can be used to restrict
the amount of memory that is used.</p>
<h2>USER DOCUMENTATION
<a name="USER DOCUMENTATION"></a>
</h2>
<p style="margin-left:9%; margin-top: 1em">The user
documentation for PCRE2 comprises a number of different
sections. In the "man" format, each of these is a
separate "man page". In the HTML format, each is a
separate page, linked from the index page. In the plain text
format, the descriptions of the <b>pcre2grep</b> and
<b>pcre2test</b> programs are in files called
<b>pcre2grep.txt</b> and <b>pcre2test.txt</b>, respectively.
The remaining sections, except for the <b>pcre2demo</b>
section (which is a program listing), and the short pages
for individual functions, are concatenated in
<b>pcre2.txt</b>, for ease of searching. The sections are as
follows:</p>
