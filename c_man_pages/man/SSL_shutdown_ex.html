<h2>DESCRIPTION
<a name="DESCRIPTION"></a>
</h2>
<p style="margin-left:9%; margin-top: 1em"><b>SSL_shutdown()</b>
shuts down an active connection represented by an SSL
object.</p>
<p style="margin-left:9%; margin-top: 1em"><b>SSL_shutdown_ex()</b>
is an extended version of <b>SSL_shutdown()</b>. If
non−NULL, <i>args</i> must point to a
<b>SSL_SHUTDOWN_EX_ARGS</b> structure and <i>args_len</i>
must be set to sizeof(SSL_SHUTDOWN_EX_ARGS). The
<b>SSL_SHUTDOWN_EX_ARGS</b> structure must be
zero−initialized. If <i>args</i> is NULL, the
behaviour is the same as passing a zero−initialised
<b>SSL_SHUTDOWN_EX_ARGS</b> structure. Currently, all
extended arguments relate to usage with QUIC, therefore this
call functions identically to <b>SSL_shutdown()</b> when not
being used with QUIC.</p>
<p style="margin-left:9%; margin-top: 1em">While the
general operation of <b>SSL_shutdown()</b> is common between
protocols, the exact nature of how a shutdown is performed
depends on the underlying protocol being used. See the
section below pertaining to each protocol for more
information.</p>
<p style="margin-left:9%; margin-top: 1em">In general,
calling <b>SSL_shutdown()</b> in nonblocking mode will
initiate the shutdown process and return 0 to indicate that
the shutdown process has not yet completed. Once the
shutdown process has completed, subsequent calls to
<b>SSL_shutdown()</b> will return 1. See the RETURN VALUES
section for more information.</p>
<p style="margin-left:9%; margin-top: 1em"><b>SSL_shutdown()</b>
should not be called if a previous fatal error has occurred
on a connection; i.e., if <b>SSL_get_error</b>(3) has
returned <b>SSL_ERROR_SYSCALL</b> or
<b>SSL_ERROR_SSL</b>.</p>
<h2>TLS AND DTLS−SPECIFIC CONSIDERATIONS
<a name="TLS AND DTLS−SPECIFIC CONSIDERATIONS"></a>
</h2>
<p style="margin-left:9%; margin-top: 1em">Shutdown for
SSL/TLS and DTLS is implemented in terms of the SSL/TLS/DTLS
close_notify alert message. The shutdown process for SSL/TLS
and DTLS consists of two steps:</p>
<table border="0" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" frame="void" rules="none" width="100%">
<tr align="left" valign="top">
<td width="9%"></td>
<td width="1%">
<p>•</p></td>
<td width="4%"></td>
<td width="82%">
<p>A close_notify shutdown alert message is sent to the
peer.</p> </td>
<td width="4%">
</td></tr>
<tr align="left" valign="top">
<td width="9%"></td>
<td width="1%">
<p>•</p></td>
<td width="4%"></td>
<td width="82%">
<p>A close_notify shutdown alert message is received from
the peer.</p></td>
<td width="4%">
</td></tr>
</table>
<p style="margin-left:9%; margin-top: 1em">These steps can
occur in either order depending on whether the connection
shutdown process was first initiated by the local
application or by the peer.</p>
<h3>Locally−Initiated Shutdown
<a name="Locally−Initiated Shutdown"></a>
</h3>
<p style="margin-left:9%; margin-top: 1em">Calling
<b>SSL_shutdown()</b> on a SSL/TLS or DTLS SSL object
initiates the shutdown process and causes OpenSSL to try to
send a close_notify shutdown alert to the peer. The shutdown
process will then be considered completed once the peer
responds in turn with a close_notify shutdown alert
message.</p>
<p style="margin-left:9%; margin-top: 1em">Calling
<b>SSL_shutdown()</b> only closes the write direction of the
connection; the read direction is closed by the peer. Once
<b>SSL_shutdown()</b> is called, <b>SSL_write</b>(3) can no
longer be used, but <b>SSL_read</b>(3) may still be used
until the peer decides to close the connection in turn. The
peer might continue sending data for some period of time
before handling the local application's shutdown
indication.</p>
<p style="margin-left:9%; margin-top: 1em"><b>SSL_shutdown()</b>
does not affect an underlying network connection such as a
TCP connection, which remains open.</p>
<h3>Remotely−Initiated Shutdown
<a name="Remotely−Initiated Shutdown"></a>
</h3>
<p style="margin-left:9%; margin-top: 1em">If the peer was
the first to initiate the shutdown process by sending a
close_notify alert message, an application will be notified
of this as an EOF condition when calling <b>SSL_read</b>(3)
(i.e., <b>SSL_read</b>(3) will fail and
<b>SSL_get_error</b>(3) will return
<b>SSL_ERROR_ZERO_RETURN</b>), after all application data
sent by the peer prior to initiating the shutdown has been
read. An application should handle this condition by calling
<b>SSL_shutdown()</b> to respond with a close_notify alert
in turn, completing the shutdown process, though it may
choose to write additional application data using
<b>SSL_write</b>(3) before doing so. If an application does
not call <b>SSL_shutdown()</b> in this case, a close_notify
alert will not be sent and the behaviour will not be fully
standards compliant.</p>
<h3>Shutdown Lifecycle
<a name="Shutdown Lifecycle"></a>
</h3>
<p style="margin-left:9%; margin-top: 1em">Regardless of
whether a shutdown was initiated locally or by the peer, if
the underlying BIO is blocking, a call to
<b>SSL_shutdown()</b> will return firstly once a
close_notify alert message is written to the peer (returning
0), and upon a second and subsequent call, once a
corresponding message is received from the peer (returning 1
and completing the shutdown process). Calls to
<b>SSL_shutdown()</b> with a blocking underlying BIO will
also return if an error occurs.</p>
<p style="margin-left:9%; margin-top: 1em">If the
underlying BIO is nonblocking and the shutdown process is
not yet complete (for example, because a close_notify alert
message has not yet been received from the peer, or because
a close_notify alert message needs to be sent but would
currently block), <b>SSL_shutdown()</b> returns 0 to
indicate that the shutdown process is still ongoing; in this
case, a call to <b>SSL_get_error</b>(3) will yield
<b>SSL_ERROR_WANT_READ</b> or
<b>SSL_ERROR_WANT_WRITE</b>.</p>
<p style="margin-left:9%; margin-top: 1em">An application
can then detect completion of the shutdown process by
calling <b>SSL_shutdown()</b> again repeatedly until it
returns 1, indicating that the shutdown process is complete
(with a close_notify alert having both been sent and
received).</p>
<p style="margin-left:9%; margin-top: 1em">However, the
preferred method of waiting for the shutdown to complete is
to use <b>SSL_read</b>(3) until <b>SSL_get_error</b>(3)
indicates EOF by returning <b>SSL_ERROR_ZERO_RETURN</b>.
This ensures any data received immediately before the peer's
close_notify alert is still provided to the application. It
also ensures any final handshake−layer messages
received are processed (for example, messages issuing new
session tickets).</p>
<p style="margin-left:9%; margin-top: 1em">If this approach
is not used, the second call to <b>SSL_shutdown()</b> (to
complete the shutdown by confirming receipt of the peer's
close_notify message) will fail if it is called when the
application has not read all pending application data sent
by the peer using <b>SSL_read</b>(3).</p>
<p style="margin-left:9%; margin-top: 1em">When calling
<b>SSL_shutdown()</b>, the <b>SSL_SENT_SHUTDOWN</b> flag is
set once an attempt is made to send a close_notify alert,
regardless of whether the attempt was successful. The
<b>SSL_RECEIVED_SHUTDOWN</b> flag is set once a close_notify
alert is received, which may occur during any call which
processes incoming data from the network, such as
<b>SSL_read</b>(3) or <b>SSL_shutdown()</b>. These flags may
be checked using <b>SSL_get_shutdown</b>(3).</p>
<h3>Fast Shutdown
<a name="Fast Shutdown"></a>
</h3>
<p style="margin-left:9%; margin-top: 1em">Alternatively,
it is acceptable for an application to call
<b>SSL_shutdown()</b> once (such that it returns 0) and then
close the underlying connection without waiting for the
peer's response. This allows for a more rapid shutdown
process if the application does not wish to wait for the
peer.</p>
<p style="margin-left:9%; margin-top: 1em">This alternative
"fast shutdown" approach should only be done if it
is known that the peer will not send more data, otherwise
there is a risk of an application exposing itself to a
truncation attack. The full <b>SSL_shutdown()</b> process,
in which both parties send close_notify alerts and
<b>SSL_shutdown()</b> returns 1, provides a
cryptographically authenticated indication of the end of a
connection.</p>
<p style="margin-left:9%; margin-top: 1em">This approach of
a single <b>SSL_shutdown()</b> call without waiting is
preferable to simply calling <b>SSL_free</b>(3) or
<b>SSL_clear</b>(3) as calling <b>SSL_shutdown()</b>
beforehand makes an SSL session eligible for subsequent
reuse and notifies the peer of connection shutdown.</p>
<p style="margin-left:9%; margin-top: 1em">The fast
shutdown approach can only be used if there is no intention
to reuse the underlying connection (e.g. a TCP connection)
for further communication; in this case, the full shutdown
process must be performed to ensure synchronisation.</p>
<h3>Effects on Session Reuse
<a name="Effects on Session Reuse"></a>
</h3>
<p style="margin-left:9%; margin-top: 1em">Calling
<b>SSL_shutdown()</b> sets the SSL_SENT_SHUTDOWN flag (see
<b>SSL_set_shutdown</b>(3)), regardless of whether the
transmission of the close_notify alert was successful or
not. This makes the SSL session eligible for reuse; the SSL
session is considered properly closed and can be reused for
future connections.</p>
<h3>Quiet Shutdown
<a name="Quiet Shutdown"></a>
</h3>
<p style="margin-left:9%; margin-top: 1em"><b>SSL_shutdown()</b>
can be modified to set the connection to the
"shutdown" state without actually sending a
close_notify alert message; see
<b>SSL_CTX_set_quiet_shutdown</b>(3). When "quiet
shutdown" is enabled, <b>SSL_shutdown()</b> will always
succeed and return 1 immediately.</p>
<p style="margin-left:9%; margin-top: 1em">This is not
standards−compliant behaviour. It should only be done
when the application protocol in use enables the peer to
ensure that all data has been received, such that it doesn't
need to wait for a close_notify alert, otherwise application
data may be truncated unexpectedly.</p>
<h3>Non−Compliant Peers
<a name="Non−Compliant Peers"></a>
</h3>
<p style="margin-left:9%; margin-top: 1em">There are
SSL/TLS implementations that never send the required
close_notify alert message but simply close the underlying
transport (e.g. a TCP connection) instead. This will
ordinarily result in an error being generated.</p>
<p style="margin-left:9%; margin-top: 1em">If compatibility
with such peers is desired, the option
<b>SSL_OP_IGNORE_UNEXPECTED_EOF</b> can be set. For more
information, see <b>SSL_CTX_set_options</b>(3).</p>
<p style="margin-left:9%; margin-top: 1em">Note that use of
this option means that the EOF condition for application
data does not receive cryptographic protection, and
therefore renders an application potentially vulnerable to
truncation attacks. Thus, this option must only be used in
conjunction with an application protocol which indicates
unambiguously when all data has been received.</p>
<p style="margin-left:9%; margin-top: 1em">An alternative
approach is to simply avoid calling <b>SSL_read</b>(3) if it
is known that no more data is going to be sent. This
requires an application protocol which indicates
unambiguously when all data has been sent.</p>
<h3>Session Ticket Handling
<a name="Session Ticket Handling"></a>
</h3>
<p style="margin-left:9%; margin-top: 1em">If a client
application only writes to a SSL/TLS or DTLS connection and
never reads, OpenSSL may never process new SSL/TLS session
tickets sent by the server. This is because OpenSSL
ordinarily processes handshake messages received from a peer
during calls to <b>SSL_read</b>(3) by the application.</p>
<p style="margin-left:9%; margin-top: 1em">Therefore,
client applications which only write and do not read but
which wish to benefit from session resumption are advised to
perform a complete shutdown procedure by calling
<b>SSL_shutdown()</b> until it returns 1, as described
above. This will ensure there is an opportunity for SSL/TLS
session ticket messages to be received and processed by
OpenSSL.</p>
<h2>QUIC−SPECIFIC SHUTDOWN CONSIDERATIONS
<a name="QUIC−SPECIFIC SHUTDOWN CONSIDERATIONS"></a>
</h2>
<p style="margin-left:9%; margin-top: 1em">When used with a
QUIC connection SSL object, <b>SSL_shutdown()</b> initiates
a QUIC immediate close using QUIC <b>CONNECTION_CLOSE</b>
frames.</p>
<p style="margin-left:9%; margin-top: 1em"><b>SSL_shutdown()</b>
cannot be used on QUIC stream SSL objects. To conclude a
stream normally, see <b>SSL_stream_conclude</b>(3); to
perform a non−normal stream termination, see
<b>SSL_stream_reset</b>(3).</p>
<p style="margin-left:9%; margin-top: 1em"><b>SSL_shutdown_ex()</b>
may be used instead of <b>SSL_shutdown()</b> by an
application to provide additional information to the peer on
the reason why a connection is being shut down. The
information which can be provided is as follows: <i><br/>
quic_error_code</i></p>
<p style="margin-left:14%;">An optional 62−bit
application error code to be signalled to the peer. The
value must be in the range [0, 2**62−1], else the call
to <b>SSL_shutdown_ex()</b> fails. If not provided, an error
code of 0 is used by default.</p>
<p style="margin-left:9%;"><i>quic_reason</i></p>
<p style="margin-left:14%;">An optional
zero−terminated (UTF−8) reason string to be
signalled to the peer. The application is responsible for
providing a valid UTF−8 string and OpenSSL will not
validate the string. If a reason is not provided, or
<b>SSL_shutdown()</b> is used, a zero−length string is
used as the reason. If provided, the reason string is copied
and stored inside the QUIC connection SSL object and need
not remain allocated after the call to
<b>SSL_shutdown_ex()</b> returns. Reason strings are bounded
by the path MTU and may be silently truncated if they are
too long to fit in a QUIC packet.</p>
<p style="margin-left:14%; margin-top: 1em">Reason strings
are intended for human diagnostic purposes only, and should
not be used for application signalling.</p>
<p style="margin-left:9%; margin-top: 1em">The arguments to
<b>SSL_shutdown_ex()</b> are used only on the first call to
<b>SSL_shutdown_ex()</b> (or <b>SSL_shutdown()</b>) for a
given QUIC connection SSL object. These arguments are
ignored on subsequent calls.</p>
<p style="margin-left:9%; margin-top: 1em">These functions
do not affect an underlying network BIO or the resource it
represents; for example, a UDP datagram provided to a QUIC
connection as the network BIO will remain open.</p>
<p style="margin-left:9%; margin-top: 1em">Note that when
using QUIC, an application must call <b>SSL_shutdown()</b>
if it wants to ensure that all transmitted data was received
by the peer. This is unlike a TLS/TCP connection, where
reliable transmission of buffered data is the responsibility
of the operating system. If an application calls
<b>SSL_free()</b> on a QUIC connection SSL object or exits
before completing the shutdown process using
<b>SSL_shutdown()</b>, data which was written by the
application using <b>SSL_write()</b>, but could not yet be
transmitted, or which was sent but lost in the network, may
not be received by the peer.</p>
<p style="margin-left:9%; margin-top: 1em">When using QUIC,
calling <b>SSL_shutdown()</b> allows internal network event
processing to be performed. It is important that this
processing is performed regularly, whether during connection
usage or during shutdown. If an application is not using
thread assisted mode, an application conducting shutdown
should either ensure that <b>SSL_shutdown()</b> is called
regularly, or alternatively ensure that
<b>SSL_handle_events()</b> is called regularly. See
<b>openssl−quic</b>(7) and <b>SSL_handle_events</b>(3)
for more information.</p>
<h3>Application Data Drainage Behaviour
<a name="Application Data Drainage Behaviour"></a>
</h3>
<p style="margin-left:9%; margin-top: 1em">When using QUIC,
<b>SSL_shutdown()</b> or <b>SSL_shutdown_ex()</b> ordinarily
waits until all data written to a stream by an application
has been acknowledged by the peer. In other words, the
shutdown process waits until all data written by the
application has been sent to the peer, and until the receipt
of all such data is acknowledged by the peer. Only once this
process is completed is the shutdown considered
complete.</p>
<p style="margin-left:9%; margin-top: 1em">An exception to
this is streams which terminated in a non−normal
fashion, for example due to a stream reset; only streams
which are non−terminated at the time
<b>SSL_shutdown()</b> is called, or which terminated in a
normal fashion, have their pending send buffers flushed in
this manner.</p>
<p style="margin-left:9%; margin-top: 1em">This behaviour
of flushing streams during the shutdown process can be
skipped by setting the
<b>SSL_SHUTDOWN_FLAG_NO_STREAM_FLUSH</b> flag in a call to
<b>SSL_shutdown_ex()</b>; in this case, data remaining in
stream send buffers may not be transmitted to the peer. This
flag may be used when a non−normal application
condition has occurred and the delivery of data written to
streams via <b>SSL_write</b>(3) is no longer relevant.</p>
<h3>Shutdown Mode
<a name="Shutdown Mode"></a>
</h3>
<p style="margin-left:9%; margin-top: 1em">Aspects of how
QUIC handles connection closure must be taken into account
by applications. Ordinarily, QUIC expects a connection to
continue to be serviced for a substantial period of time
after it is nominally closed. This is necessary to ensure
that any connection closure notification sent to the peer
was successfully received. However, a consequence of this is
that a fully RFC−compliant QUIC connection closure
process could take of the order of seconds. This may be
unsuitable for some applications, such as short−lived
processes which need to exit immediately after completing an
application−layer transaction.</p>
<p style="margin-left:9%; margin-top: 1em">As such, there
are two shutdown modes available to users of QUIC connection
SSL objects: <br/>
RFC compliant shutdown mode</p>
<p style="margin-left:14%;">This is the default behaviour.
The shutdown process may take a period of time up to three
times the current estimated RTT to the peer. It is possible
for the closure process to complete much faster in some
circumstances but this cannot be relied upon.</p>
<p style="margin-left:14%; margin-top: 1em">In blocking
mode, the function will return once the closure process is
complete. In nonblocking mode, <b>SSL_shutdown_ex()</b>
should be called until it returns 1, indicating the closure
process is complete and the connection is now fully shut
down.</p>
<p style="margin-left:9%;">Rapid shutdown mode</p>
<p style="margin-left:14%;">In this mode, the peer is
notified of connection closure on a best effort basis by
sending a single QUIC packet. If that QUIC packet is lost,
the peer will not know that the connection has terminated
until the negotiated idle timeout (if any) expires.</p>
<p style="margin-left:14%; margin-top: 1em">This will
generally return 0 on success, indicating that the
connection has not yet been fully shut down (unless it has
already done so, in which case it will return 1).</p>
<p style="margin-left:9%; margin-top: 1em">If
<b>SSL_SHUTDOWN_FLAG_RAPID</b> is specified in <i>flags</i>,
a rapid shutdown is performed, otherwise an
RFC−compliant shutdown is performed.</p>
<p style="margin-left:9%; margin-top: 1em">If an
application calls <b>SSL_shutdown_ex()</b> with
<b>SSL_SHUTDOWN_FLAG_RAPID</b>, an application can
subsequently change its mind about performing a rapid
shutdown by making a subsequent call to
<b>SSL_shutdown_ex()</b> without the flag set.</p>
<h3>Peer−Initiated Shutdown
<a name="Peer−Initiated Shutdown"></a>
</h3>
<p style="margin-left:9%; margin-top: 1em">In some cases,
an application may wish to wait for a shutdown initiated by
the peer rather than triggered locally. To do this, call
<b>SSL_shutdown_ex()</b> with
<i>SSL_SHUTDOWN_FLAG_WAIT_PEER</i> specified in
<i>flags</i>. In blocking mode, this waits until the peer
initiates a shutdown or the connection otherwise becomes
terminated for another reason. In nonblocking mode it exits
immediately with either success or failure depending on
whether a shutdown has occurred.</p>
<p style="margin-left:9%; margin-top: 1em">If a locally
initiated shutdown has already been triggered or the
connection has started terminating for another reason, this
flag has no effect.</p>
<p style="margin-left:9%; margin-top: 1em"><b>SSL_SHUTDOWN_FLAG_WAIT_PEER</b>
implies <b>SSL_SHUTDOWN_FLAG_NO_STREAM_FLUSH</b>, as stream
data cannot be flushed after a peer closes the connection.
Stream data may still be sent to the peer in any time spent
waiting before the peer closes the connection, though there
is no guarantee of this.</p>
<h3>Nonblocking Mode
<a name="Nonblocking Mode"></a>
</h3>
<p style="margin-left:9%; margin-top: 1em"><b>SSL_shutdown()</b>
and <b>SSL_shutdown_ex()</b> block if the connection is
configured in blocking mode. This may be overridden by
specifying <b>SSL_SHUTDOWN_FLAG_NO_BLOCK</b> in <i>flags</i>
when calling <b>SSL_shutdown_ex()</b>, which causes the call
to operate as though in nonblocking mode.</p>
<h2>RETURN VALUES
<a name="RETURN VALUES"></a>
</h2>
<p style="margin-left:9%; margin-top: 1em">For both
<b>SSL_shutdown()</b> and <b>SSL_shutdown_ex()</b> the
following return values can occur:</p>

</table>
<p style="margin-left:14%; margin-top: 1em">For TLS and
DTLS, this means that a close_notify alert has been sent but
the peer has not yet replied in turn with its own
close_notify.</p>
<p style="margin-left:14%; margin-top: 1em">For QUIC
connection SSL objects, a CONNECTION_CLOSE frame may have
been sent but the connection closure process has not yet
completed.</p>
<p style="margin-left:14%; margin-top: 1em">Unlike most
other functions, returning 0 does not indicate an error.
<b>SSL_get_error</b>(3) should not be called; it may
misleadingly indicate an error even though no error
occurred.</p>
