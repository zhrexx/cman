<h2>NAME
<a name="NAME"></a>
</h2>
<p style="margin-left:9%; margin-top: 1em">libcurl−security
− security considerations when using libcurl</p>
<h2>Security
<a name="Security"></a>
</h2>
<p style="margin-left:9%; margin-top: 1em">The libcurl
project takes security seriously. The library is written
with caution and precautions are taken to mitigate many
kinds of risks encountered while operating with potentially
malicious servers on the Internet. It is a powerful library,
however, which allows application writers to make
trade−offs between ease of writing and exposure to
potential risky operations. If used the right way, you can
use libcurl to transfer data pretty safely.</p>
<p style="margin-left:9%; margin-top: 1em">Many
applications are used in closed networks where users and
servers can (possibly) be trusted, but many others are used
on arbitrary servers and are fed input from potentially
untrusted users. Following is a discussion about some risks
in the ways in which applications commonly use libcurl and
potential mitigations of those risks. It is not
comprehensive, but shows classes of attacks that robust
applications should consider. The Common Weakness
Enumeration project at https://cwe.mitre.org/ is a good
reference for many of these and similar types of weaknesses
of which application writers should be aware.</p>
<h2>Command Lines
<a name="Command Lines"></a>
</h2>
<p style="margin-left:9%; margin-top: 1em">If you use a
command line tool (such as curl) that uses libcurl, and you
give options to the tool on the command line those options
can get read by other users of your system when they use
<i>ps</i> or other tools to list currently running
processes.</p>
<p style="margin-left:9%; margin-top: 1em">To avoid these
problems, never feed sensitive things to programs using
command line options. Write them to a protected file and use
the −K option to avoid this.</p>
<h2>.netrc
<a name=".netrc"></a>
</h2>
<p style="margin-left:9%; margin-top: 1em">.netrc is a
pretty handy file/feature that allows you to login quickly
and automatically to frequently visited sites. The file
contains passwords in clear text and is a real security
risk. In some cases, your .netrc is also stored in a home
directory that is NFS mounted or used on another network
based file system, so the clear text password flies through
your network every time anyone reads that file.</p>
<p style="margin-left:9%; margin-top: 1em">For applications
that enable .netrc use, a user who manage to set the right
URL might then be possible to pass on passwords.</p>
<p style="margin-left:9%; margin-top: 1em">To avoid these
problems, do not use .netrc files and never store passwords
in plain text anywhere.</p>
<h2>Clear Text Passwords
<a name="Clear Text Passwords"></a>
</h2>
<p style="margin-left:9%; margin-top: 1em">Many of the
protocols libcurl supports send name and password
unencrypted as clear text (HTTP Basic authentication, FTP,
TELNET etc). It is easy for anyone on your network or a
network nearby yours to just fire up a network analyzer tool
and eavesdrop on your passwords. Do not let the fact that
HTTP Basic uses base64 encoded passwords fool you. They may
not look readable at a first glance, but they are easily
"deciphered" by anyone within seconds.</p>
<p style="margin-left:9%; margin-top: 1em">To avoid this
problem, use an authentication mechanism or other protocol
that does not let snoopers see your password: Digest,
CRAM−MD5, Kerberos, SPNEGO or NTLM authentication. Or
even better: use authenticated protocols that protect the
entire connection and everything sent over it.</p>
<h2>Unauthenticated Connections
<a name="Unauthenticated Connections"></a>
</h2>
<p style="margin-left:9%; margin-top: 1em">Protocols that
do not have any form of cryptographic authentication cannot
with any certainty know that they communicate with the right
remote server.</p>
<p style="margin-left:9%; margin-top: 1em">If your
application is using a fixed scheme or fixed hostname, it is
not safe as long as the connection is unauthenticated. There
can be a man−in−the−middle or in fact the
whole server might have been replaced by an evil actor.</p>
<p style="margin-left:9%; margin-top: 1em">Unauthenticated
protocols are unsafe. The data that comes back to curl may
have been injected by an attacker. The data that curl sends
might be modified before it reaches the intended server. If
it even reaches the intended server at all.</p>
<p style="margin-left:9%; margin-top: 1em">Remedies: <br/>
Restrict operations to authenticated transfers</p>
<p style="margin-left:18%;">Use authenticated protocols
protected with HTTPS or SSH.</p>
<p style="margin-left:9%;">Make sure the server’s
certificate etc is verified</p>
<p style="margin-left:18%;">Never ever switch off
certificate verification.</p>
<h2>Redirects
<a name="Redirects"></a>
</h2>
<p style="margin-left:9%; margin-top: 1em">The
<i>CURLOPT_FOLLOWLOCATION(3)</i> option automatically
follows HTTP redirects sent by a remote server. These
redirects can refer to any kind of URL, not just HTTP.
libcurl restricts the protocols allowed to be used in
redirects for security reasons: only HTTP, HTTPS, FTP and
FTPS are enabled by default. Applications may opt to
restrict that set further.</p>
<p style="margin-left:9%; margin-top: 1em">A redirect to a
file: URL would cause the libcurl to read (or write)
arbitrary files from the local filesystem. If the
application returns the data back to the user (as would
happen in some kinds of CGI scripts), an attacker could
leverage this to read otherwise forbidden data (e.g.
<b>file://localhost/etc/passwd</b>).</p>
<p style="margin-left:9%; margin-top: 1em">If
authentication credentials are stored in the ˜/.netrc
file, or Kerberos is in use, any other URL type (not just
file:) that requires authentication is also at risk. A
redirect such as
<b>ftp://some−internal−server/private−file</b>
would then return data even when the server is password
protected.</p>
<p style="margin-left:9%; margin-top: 1em">In the same way,
if an unencrypted SSH private key has been configured for
the user running the libcurl application, SCP: or SFTP: URLs
could access password or private−key protected
resources, e.g.
<b>sftp://user@some−internal−server/etc/passwd</b></p>
<p style="margin-left:9%; margin-top: 1em">The
<i>CURLOPT_REDIR_PROTOCOLS_STR(3)</i> and
<i>CURLOPT_NETRC(3)</i> options can be used to mitigate
against this kind of attack.</p>
<p style="margin-left:9%; margin-top: 1em">A redirect can
also specify a location available only on the machine
running libcurl, including servers hidden behind a firewall
from the attacker. E.g. <b>http://127.0.0.1/</b> or
<b>http://intranet/delete−stuff.cgi?delete=all</b> or
<b>tftp://bootp−server/pc−config−data</b></p>
<p style="margin-left:9%; margin-top: 1em">Applications can
mitigate against this by disabling
<i>CURLOPT_FOLLOWLOCATION(3)</i> and handling redirects
itself, sanitizing URLs as necessary. Alternately, an app
could leave <i>CURLOPT_FOLLOWLOCATION(3)</i> enabled but set
<i>CURLOPT_REDIR_PROTOCOLS_STR(3)</i> and install a
<i>CURLOPT_OPENSOCKETFUNCTION(3)</i> or
<i>CURLOPT_PREREQFUNCTION(3)</i> callback function in which
addresses are sanitized before use.</p>
<h2>CRLF in Headers
<a name="CRLF in Headers"></a>
</h2>
<p style="margin-left:9%; margin-top: 1em">For all options
in libcurl which specify headers, including but not limited
to <i>CURLOPT_HTTPHEADER(3)</i>,
<i>CURLOPT_PROXYHEADER(3)</i>, <i>CURLOPT_COOKIE(3)</i>,
<i>CURLOPT_USERAGENT(3)</i>, <i>CURLOPT_REFERER(3)</i> and
<i>CURLOPT_RANGE(3)</i>, libcurl sends the headers
as−is and does not apply any special sanitation or
normalization to them.</p>
<p style="margin-left:9%; margin-top: 1em">If you allow
untrusted user input into these options without sanitizing
CRLF sequences in them, someone malicious may be able to
modify the request in a way you did not intend such as
injecting new headers.</p>
<h2>Local Resources
<a name="Local Resources"></a>
</h2>
<p style="margin-left:9%; margin-top: 1em">A user who can
control the DNS server of a domain being passed in within a
URL can change the address of the host to a local, private
address which a server−side libcurl−using
application could then use. E.g. the innocuous URL
<b>http://fuzzybunnies.example.com/</b> could actually
resolve to the IP address of a server behind a firewall,
such as 127.0.0.1 or 10.1.2.3. Applications can mitigate
against this by setting a
<i>CURLOPT_OPENSOCKETFUNCTION(3)</i> or
<i>CURLOPT_PREREQFUNCTION(3)</i> and checking the address
before a connection.</p>
<p style="margin-left:9%; margin-top: 1em">All the
malicious scenarios regarding redirected URLs apply just as
well to non−redirected URLs, if the user is allowed to
specify an arbitrary URL that could point to a private
resource. For example, a web app providing a translation
service might happily translate
<b>file://localhost/etc/passwd</b> and display the result.
Applications can mitigate against this with the
<i>CURLOPT_PROTOCOLS_STR(3)</i> option as well as by similar
mitigation techniques for redirections.</p>
<p style="margin-left:9%; margin-top: 1em">A malicious FTP
server could in response to the PASV command return an IP
address and port number for a server local to the app
running libcurl but behind a firewall. Applications can
mitigate against this by using the
<i>CURLOPT_FTP_SKIP_PASV_IP(3)</i> option or
<i>CURLOPT_FTPPORT(3)</i>.</p>
<p style="margin-left:9%; margin-top: 1em">Local servers
sometimes assume local access comes from friends and trusted
users. An application that expects
https://example.com/file_to_read that and instead gets
http://192.168.0.1/my_router_config might print a file that
would otherwise be protected by the firewall.</p>
<p style="margin-left:9%; margin-top: 1em">Allowing your
application to connect to local hosts, be it the same
machine that runs the application or a machine on the same
local network, might be possible to exploit by an attacker
who then perhaps can "port−scan" the
particular hosts − depending on how the application
and servers acts.</p>
<h2>IPv4 Addresses
<a name="IPv4 Addresses"></a>
</h2>
<p style="margin-left:9%; margin-top: 1em">Some users might
be tempted to filter access to local resources or similar
based on numerical IPv4 addresses used in URLs. This is a
bad and error−prone idea because of the many different
ways a numerical IPv4 address can be specified and libcurl
accepts: one to four dot−separated fields using one of
or a mix of decimal, octal or hexadecimal encoding.</p>
<h2>IPv6 Addresses
<a name="IPv6 Addresses"></a>
</h2>
<p style="margin-left:9%; margin-top: 1em">libcurl handles
IPv6 addresses transparently and just as easily as IPv4
addresses. That means that a sanitizing function that
filters out addresses like 127.0.0.1 is not sufficient
− the equivalent IPv6 addresses <b>::1</b>, <b>::</b>,
<b>0:00::0:1</b>, <b>::127.0.0.1</b> and
<b>::ffff:7f00:1</b> supplied somehow by an attacker would
all bypass a naive filter and could allow access to
undesired local resources. IPv6 also has special address
blocks like link−local and site−local that
generally should not be accessed by a server−side
libcurl−using application. A poorly configured
firewall installed in a data center, organization or server
may also be configured to limit IPv4 connections but leave
IPv6 connections wide open. In some cases, setting
<i>CURLOPT_IPRESOLVE(3)</i> to CURL_IPRESOLVE_V4 can be used
to limit resolved addresses to IPv4 only and bypass these
issues.</p>
<h2>Uploads
<a name="Uploads"></a>
</h2>
<p style="margin-left:9%; margin-top: 1em">When uploading,
a redirect can cause a local (or remote) file to be
overwritten. Applications must not allow any unsanitized URL
to be passed in for uploads. Also,
<i>CURLOPT_FOLLOWLOCATION(3)</i> should not be used on
uploads. Instead, the applications should consider handling
redirects itself, sanitizing each URL first.</p>
<h2>Authentication
<a name="Authentication"></a>
</h2>
<p style="margin-left:9%; margin-top: 1em">Use of
<i>CURLOPT_UNRESTRICTED_AUTH(3)</i> could cause
authentication information to be sent to an unknown second
server. Applications can mitigate against this by disabling
<i>CURLOPT_FOLLOWLOCATION(3)</i> and handling redirects
itself, sanitizing where necessary.</p>
<p style="margin-left:9%; margin-top: 1em">Use of the
CURLAUTH_ANY option to <i>CURLOPT_HTTPAUTH(3)</i> could
result in username and password being sent in clear text to
an HTTP server. Instead, use CURLAUTH_ANYSAFE which ensures
that the password is encrypted over the network, or else
fail the request.</p>
<p style="margin-left:9%; margin-top: 1em">Use of the
CURLUSESSL_TRY option to <i>CURLOPT_USE_SSL(3)</i> could
result in username and password being sent in clear text to
an FTP server. Instead, use CURLUSESSL_CONTROL to ensure
that an encrypted connection is used or else fail the
request.</p>
<h2>Cookies
<a name="Cookies"></a>
</h2>
<p style="margin-left:9%; margin-top: 1em">If cookies are
enabled and cached, then a user could craft a URL which
performs some malicious action to a site whose
authentication is already stored in a cookie. E.g.
<b>http://mail.example.com/delete−stuff.cgi?delete=all</b>
Applications can mitigate against this by disabling cookies
or clearing them between requests.</p>
<h2>Dangerous SCP URLs
<a name="Dangerous SCP URLs"></a>
</h2>
<p style="margin-left:9%; margin-top: 1em">SCP URLs can
contain raw commands within the scp: URL, which is a side
effect of how the SCP protocol is designed. E.g. <br/>
scp://user:pass@host/a;date &gt;/tmp/test; <br/>
Applications must not allow unsanitized SCP: URLs to be
passed in for downloads.</p>
<h2>file://
<a name="file://"></a>
</h2>
<p style="margin-left:9%; margin-top: 1em">By default curl
and libcurl support file:// URLs. Such a URL is always an
access, or attempted access, to a local resource. If your
application wants to avoid that, keep control of what URLs
to use and/or prevent curl/libcurl from using the
protocol.</p>
<p style="margin-left:9%; margin-top: 1em">By default,
libcurl prohibits redirects to file:// URLs.</p>
<h2>Warning: file:// on Windows
<a name="Warning: file:// on Windows"></a>
</h2>
<p style="margin-left:9%; margin-top: 1em">The Windows
operating system tries automatically, and without any way
for applications to disable it, to establish a connection to
another host over the network and access it (over SMB or
other protocols), if only the correct file path is
accessed.</p>
<p style="margin-left:9%; margin-top: 1em">When first
realizing this, the curl team tried to filter out such
attempts in order to protect applications for inadvertent
probes of for example internal networks etc. This resulted
in CVE−2019−15601 and the associated security
fix.</p>
<p style="margin-left:9%; margin-top: 1em">However, we have
since been made aware of the fact that the previous fix was
far from adequate as there are several other ways to
accomplish more or less the same thing: accessing a remote
host over the network instead of the local file system.</p>
<p style="margin-left:9%; margin-top: 1em">The conclusion
we have come to is that this is a weakness or feature in the
Windows operating system itself, that we as an application
cannot safely protect users against. It would just be a
whack−a−mole race we do not want to participate
in. There are too many ways to do it and there is no knob we
can use to turn off the practice.</p>
<p style="margin-left:9%; margin-top: 1em">If you use curl
or libcurl on Windows (any version), disable the use of the
FILE protocol in curl or be prepared that accesses to a
range of "magic paths" potentially make your
system access other hosts on your network. curl cannot
protect you against this.</p>
<h2>What if the user can set the URL
<a name="What if the user can set the URL"></a>
</h2>
<p style="margin-left:9%; margin-top: 1em">Applications may
find it tempting to let users set the URL that it can work
on. That is probably fine, but opens up for mischief and
trickery that you as an application author may want to
address or take precautions against.</p>
<p style="margin-left:9%; margin-top: 1em">If your
curl−using script allow a custom URL do you also,
perhaps unintentionally, allow the user to pass other
options to the curl command line if creative use of special
characters are applied?</p>
<p style="margin-left:9%; margin-top: 1em">If the user can
set the URL, the user can also specify the scheme part to
other protocols that you did not intend for users to use and
perhaps did not consider. curl supports over 20 different
URL schemes. "http://" might be what you thought,
"ftp://" or "imap://" might be what the
user gives your application. Also, cross−protocol
operations might be done by using a particular scheme in the
URL but point to a server doing a different protocol on a
non−standard port.</p>
<p style="margin-left:9%; margin-top: 1em">Remedies: <br/>
Use --proto</p>
<p style="margin-left:18%;">curl command lines can use
<i>−-proto</i> to limit what URL schemes it
accepts</p>
<p style="margin-left:9%;">Use CURLOPT_PROTOCOLS_STR</p>
<p style="margin-left:18%;">libcurl programs can use
<i>CURLOPT_PROTOCOLS_STR(3)</i> to limit what URL schemes it
accepts</p>
<p style="margin-left:9%;">consider not allowing the user
to set the full URL</p>
<p style="margin-left:18%;">Maybe just let the user provide
data for parts of it? Or maybe filter input to only allow
specific choices?</p>
<h2>RFC 3986 vs WHATWG URL
<a name="RFC 3986 vs WHATWG URL"></a>
</h2>
<p style="margin-left:9%; margin-top: 1em">curl supports
URLs mostly according to how they are defined in RFC 3986,
and has done so since the beginning.</p>
<p style="margin-left:9%; margin-top: 1em">Web browsers
mostly adhere to the WHATWG URL Specification.</p>
<p style="margin-left:9%; margin-top: 1em">This deviance
makes some URLs copied between browsers (or returned over
HTTP for redirection) and curl not work the same way. It can
also cause problems if an application parses URLs
differently from libcurl and makes different assumptions
about a link. This can mislead users into getting the wrong
thing, connecting to the wrong host or otherwise not working
identically.</p>
<p style="margin-left:9%; margin-top: 1em">Within an
application, this can be mitigated by always using the
<i>curl_url(3)</i> API to parse URLs, ensuring that they are
parsed the same way as within libcurl itself.</p>
<h2>FTP uses two connections
<a name="FTP uses two connections"></a>
</h2>
<p style="margin-left:9%; margin-top: 1em">When performing
an FTP transfer, two TCP connections are used: one for
setting up the transfer and one for the actual data.</p>
<p style="margin-left:9%; margin-top: 1em">FTP is not only
unauthenticated, but the setting up of the second transfer
is also a weak spot. The second connection to use for data,
is either setup with the PORT/EPRT command that makes the
server connect back to the client on the given IP+PORT, or
with PASV/EPSV that makes the server setup a port to listen
to and tells the client to connect to a given IP+PORT.</p>
<p style="margin-left:9%; margin-top: 1em">Again,
unauthenticated means that the connection might be meddled
with by a man−in−the−middle or that there
is a malicious server pretending to be the right one.</p>
<p style="margin-left:9%; margin-top: 1em">A malicious FTP
server can respond to PASV commands with the IP+PORT of a
totally different machine. Perhaps even a third party host,
and when there are many clients trying to connect to that
third party, it could create a Distributed
Denial−Of−Service attack out of it. If the
client makes an upload operation, it can make the client
send the data to another site. If the attacker can affect
what data the client uploads, it can be made to work as a
HTTP request and then the client could be made to issue HTTP
requests to third party hosts.</p>
<p style="margin-left:9%; margin-top: 1em">An attacker that
manages to control curl's command line options can tell curl
to send an FTP PORT command to ask the server to connect to
a third party host instead of back to curl.</p>
<p style="margin-left:9%; margin-top: 1em">The fact that
FTP uses two connections makes it vulnerable in a way that
is hard to avoid.</p>
<h2>Active FTP passes on the local IP address
<a name="Active FTP passes on the local IP address"></a>
</h2>
<p style="margin-left:9%; margin-top: 1em">If you use
curl/libcurl to do <i>active</i> FTP transfers, curl passes
on the address of your local IP to the remote server −
even when for example using a SOCKS or HTTP proxy in between
curl and the target server.</p>
<h2>Denial of Service
<a name="Denial of Service"></a>
</h2>
<p style="margin-left:9%; margin-top: 1em">A malicious
server could cause libcurl to effectively hang by sending
data slowly, or even no data at all but just keeping the TCP
connection open. This could effectively result in a
denial−of−service attack. The
<i>CURLOPT_TIMEOUT(3)</i> and/or
<i>CURLOPT_LOW_SPEED_LIMIT(3)</i> options can be used to
mitigate against this.</p>
<p style="margin-left:9%; margin-top: 1em">A malicious
server could cause libcurl to download an infinite amount of
data, potentially causing system resources to be exhausted
resulting in a system or application crash. Setting the
<i>CURLOPT_MAXFILESIZE_LARGE(3)</i> option is not sufficient
to guard against this. Instead, applications should monitor
the amount of data received within the write or progress
callback and abort once the limit is reached.</p>
<p style="margin-left:9%; margin-top: 1em">A malicious HTTP
server could cause an infinite redirection loop, causing a
denial−of−service. This can be mitigated by
using the <i>CURLOPT_MAXREDIRS(3)</i> option.</p>
<h2>Arbitrary Headers
<a name="Arbitrary Headers"></a>
</h2>
<p style="margin-left:9%; margin-top: 1em">User−supplied
data must be sanitized when used in options like
<i>CURLOPT_USERAGENT(3)</i>, <i>CURLOPT_HTTPHEADER(3)</i>,
<i>CURLOPT_POSTFIELDS(3)</i> and others that are used to
generate structured data. Characters like embedded carriage
returns or ampersands could allow the user to create
additional headers or fields that could cause malicious
transactions.</p>
<h2>Server-supplied Names
<a name="Server-supplied Names"></a>
</h2>
<p style="margin-left:9%; margin-top: 1em">A server can
supply data which the application may, in some cases, use as
a filename. The curl command−line tool does this with
<i>−-remote−header−name</i>, using the
Content−disposition: header to generate a filename. An
application could also use <i>CURLINFO_EFFECTIVE_URL(3)</i>
to generate a filename from a server−supplied redirect
URL. Special care must be taken to sanitize such names to
avoid the possibility of a malicious server supplying one
like <b>"/etc/passwd"</b>,
<b>"autoexec.bat"</b>, <b>"prn:"</b> or
even <b>".bashrc"</b>.</p>
<h2>Server Certificates
<a name="Server Certificates"></a>
</h2>
<p style="margin-left:9%; margin-top: 1em">A secure
application should never use the
<i>CURLOPT_SSL_VERIFYPEER(3)</i> option to disable
certificate validation. There are numerous attacks that are
enabled by applications that fail to properly validate
server TLS/SSL certificates, thus enabling a malicious
server to spoof a legitimate one. HTTPS without validated
certificates is potentially as insecure as a plain HTTP
connection.</p>
<h2>Showing What You Do
<a name="Showing What You Do"></a>
</h2>
<p style="margin-left:9%; margin-top: 1em">Relatedly, be
aware that in situations when you have problems with libcurl
and ask someone for help, everything you reveal in order to
get best possible help might also impose certain security
related risks. Hostnames, usernames, paths, operating system
specifics, etc. (not to mention passwords of course) may in
fact be used by intruders to gain additional information of
a potential target.</p>
<p style="margin-left:9%; margin-top: 1em">Be sure to limit
access to application logs if they could hold private or
security−related data. Besides the obvious candidates
like usernames and passwords, things like URLs, cookies or
even filenames could also hold sensitive data.</p>
<p style="margin-left:9%; margin-top: 1em">To avoid this
problem, you must of course use your common sense. Often,
you can just edit out the sensitive data or just
search/replace your true information with faked data.</p>
<h2>setuid applications using libcurl
<a name="setuid applications using libcurl"></a>
</h2>
<p style="margin-left:9%; margin-top: 1em">libcurl−using
applications that set the 'setuid' bit to run with elevated
or modified rights also implicitly give that extra power to
libcurl and this should only be done after careful
considerations.</p>
<p style="margin-left:9%; margin-top: 1em">Giving setuid
powers to the application means that libcurl can save files
using those new rights (if for example the
<i>SSLKEYLOGFILE</i> environment variable is set). Also: if
the application wants these powers to read or manage secrets
that the user is otherwise not able to view (like
credentials for a login etc), it should be noted that
libcurl still might understand proxy environment variables
that allow the user to redirect libcurl operations to use a
proxy controlled by the user.</p>
<h2>File descriptors, fork and NTLM
<a name="File descriptors, fork and NTLM"></a>
</h2>
<p style="margin-left:9%; margin-top: 1em">An application
that uses libcurl and invokes <i>fork()</i> gets all file
descriptors duplicated in the child process, including the
ones libcurl created.</p>
<p style="margin-left:9%; margin-top: 1em">libcurl itself
uses <i>fork()</i> and <i>execl()</i> if told to use the
<b>CURLAUTH_NTLM_WB</b> authentication method which then
invokes the helper command in a child process with file
descriptors duplicated. Make sure that only the trusted and
reliable helper program is invoked!</p>
<h2>Secrets in memory
<a name="Secrets in memory"></a>
</h2>
<p style="margin-left:9%; margin-top: 1em">When
applications pass usernames, passwords or other sensitive
data to libcurl to be used for upcoming transfers, those
secrets are kept around as−is in memory. In many cases
they are stored in the heap for as long as the handle itself
for which the options are set.</p>
<p style="margin-left:9%; margin-top: 1em">If an attacker
can access the heap, like maybe by reading swap space or via
a core dump file, such data might be accessible.</p>
<p style="margin-left:9%; margin-top: 1em">Further, when
eventually closing a handle and the secrets are no longer
needed, libcurl does not explicitly clear memory before
freeing it, so credentials may be left in freed data.</p>
<h2>Saving files
<a name="Saving files"></a>
</h2>
<p style="margin-left:9%; margin-top: 1em">libcurl cannot
protect against attacks where an attacker has write access
to the same directory where libcurl is directed to save
files.</p>
<h2>Cookies
<a name="Cookies"></a>
</h2>
<p style="margin-left:9%; margin-top: 1em">If libcurl is
built with PSL (<b>Public Suffix List</b>) support, it
detects and discards cookies that are specified for such
suffix domains that should not be allowed to have
cookies.</p>
<p style="margin-left:9%; margin-top: 1em">if libcurl is
<i>not</i> built with PSL support, it has no ability to stop
super cookies.</p>
<h2>Report Security Problems
<a name="Report Security Problems"></a>
</h2>
<p style="margin-left:9%; margin-top: 1em">Should you
detect or just suspect a security problem in libcurl or
curl, contact the project curl security team immediately.
