<h2>NAME
<a name="NAME"></a>
</h2>
<p style="margin-left:9%; margin-top: 1em">libunwind−dynamic
−− libunwind−support for
runtime−generated code</p>
<h2>INTRODUCTION
<a name="INTRODUCTION"></a>
</h2>
<p style="margin-left:9%; margin-top: 1em">For libunwind to
do its job, it needs to be able to reconstruct the <i>frame
state</i> of each frame in a call−chain. The frame
state describes the subset of the machine−state that
consists of the <i>frame registers</i> (typically the
instruction−pointer and the stack−pointer) and
all callee−saved registers (preserved registers). The
frame state describes each register either by providing its
current value (for frame registers) or by providing the
location at which the current value is stored
(callee−saved registers).</p>
<p style="margin-left:9%; margin-top: 1em">For statically
generated code, the compiler normally takes care of emitting
<i>unwind−info</i> which provides the minimum amount
of information needed to reconstruct the frame−state
for each instruction in a procedure. For dynamically
generated code, the runtime code generator must use the
dynamic unwind−info interface provided by libunwind to
supply the equivalent information. This manual page
describes the format of this information in detail.</p>
<p style="margin-left:9%; margin-top: 1em">For the purpose
of this discussion, a <i>procedure</i> is defined to be an
arbitrary piece of <i>contiguous</i> code. Normally, each
procedure directly corresponds to a function in the
source−language but this is not strictly required. For
example, a runtime code−generator could translate a
given function into two separate (discontiguous) procedures:
one for frequently−executed (hot) code and one for
rarely−executed (cold) code. Similarly, simple
source−language functions (usually leaf functions) may
get translated into code for which the default
unwind−conventions apply and for such code, it is not
strictly necessary to register dynamic
unwind−info.</p>
<p style="margin-left:9%; margin-top: 1em">A procedure
logically consists of a sequence of <i>regions</i>. Regions
are nested in the sense that the frame state at the end of
one region is, by default, assumed to be the frame state for
the next region. Each region is thought of as being divided
into a <i>prologue</i>, a <i>body</i>, and an
<i>epilogue</i>. Each of them can be empty. If
non−empty, the prologue sets up the frame state for
the body. For example, the prologue may need to allocate
some space on the stack and save certain callee−saved
registers. The body performs the actual work of the
procedure but does not change the frame state in any way. If
non−empty, the epilogue restores the previous frame
state and as such it undoes or cancels the effect of the
prologue. In fact, a single epilogue may undo the effect of
the prologues of several (nested) regions.</p>
<p style="margin-left:9%; margin-top: 1em">We should point
out that even though the prologue, body, and epilogue are
logically separate entities, optimizing
code−generators will generally interleave instructions
from all three entities. For this reason, the dynamic
unwind−info interface of libunwind makes no
distinction whatsoever between prologue and body. Similarly,
the exact set of instructions that make up an epilogue is
also irrelevant. The only point in the epilogue that needs
to be described explicitly by the dynamic unwind−info
is the point at which the stack−pointer gets restored.
The reason this point needs to be described is that once the
stack−pointer is restored, all values saved in the
deallocated portion of the stack frame become invalid and
hence libunwind needs to know about it. The portion of the
frame state not saved on the stack is assumed to remain
valid through the end of the region. For this reason, there
is usually no need to describe instructions which restore
the contents of callee−saved registers.</p>
<p style="margin-left:9%; margin-top: 1em">Within a region,
each instruction that affects the frame state in some
fashion needs to be described with an operation descriptor.
For this purpose, each instruction in the region is assigned
a unique index. Exactly how this index is derived depends on
the architecture. For example, on RISC and EPIC−style
architecture, instructions have a fixed size so it’s
possible to simply number the instructions. In contrast,
most CISC use variable−length instruction encodings,
so it is usually necessary to use a byte−offset as the
index. Given the instruction index, the operation descriptor
specifies the effect of the instruction in an abstract
manner. For example, it might express that the instruction
stores callee−saved register r1 at offset 16 in the
stack frame.</p>
<h2>PROCEDURES
<a name="PROCEDURES"></a>
</h2>
<p style="margin-left:9%; margin-top: 1em">A runtime
code−generator registers the dynamic unwind−info
of a procedure by setting up a structure of type
unw_dyn_info_t and calling _U_dyn_register(), passing the
address of the structure as the sole argument. The members
of the unw_dyn_info_t structure are described below: <br/>
void *next</p>
<p style="margin-left:18%;">Private to libunwind. Must not
be used by the application.</p>
<p style="margin-left:9%;">void *prev</p>
<p style="margin-left:18%;">Private to libunwind. Must not
be used by the application.</p>
<p style="margin-left:9%;">unw_word_t start_ip</p>
<p style="margin-left:18%;">The start−address of the
instructions of the procedure (remember: procedure are
defined to be contiguous pieces of code, so a single
code−range is sufficient).</p>
<p style="margin-left:9%;">unw_word_t end_ip</p>
<p style="margin-left:18%;">The end−address of the
instructions of the procedure (non−inclusive, that is,
end_ip−start_ip is the size of the procedure in
bytes).</p>
<p style="margin-left:9%;">unw_word_t gp</p>
<p style="margin-left:18%;">The global−pointer value
in use for this procedure. The exact meaning of the
global−pointer is architecture−specific and on
some architecture, it is not used at all.</p>
<p style="margin-left:9%;">int32_t format</p>
<p style="margin-left:18%;">The format of the
unwind−info. This member can be one of
UNW_INFO_FORMAT_DYNAMIC, UNW_INFO_FORMAT_TABLE, or
UNW_INFO_FORMAT_REMOTE_TABLE.</p>
<p style="margin-left:9%;">union u</p>
<p style="margin-left:18%;">This union contains one
sub−member structure for every possible
unwind−info format: <br/>
unw_dyn_proc_info_t pi</p>
<p style="margin-left:27%;">This member is used for format
UNW_INFO_FORMAT_DYNAMIC.</p>
<p style="margin-left:18%;">unw_dyn_table_info_t ti</p>
<p style="margin-left:27%;">This member is used for format
UNW_INFO_FORMAT_TABLE.</p>
<p style="margin-left:18%;">unw_dyn_remote_table_info_t
rti</p>
<p style="margin-left:27%;">This member is used for format
UNW_INFO_FORMAT_REMOTE_TABLE.</p>
<p style="margin-left:18%; margin-top: 1em">The format of
these sub−members is described in detail below.</p>
<h3>PROC−INFO FORMAT
<a name="PROC−INFO FORMAT"></a>
</h3>
<p style="margin-left:9%; margin-top: 1em">This is the
preferred dynamic unwind−info format and it is
generally the one used by full−blown runtime code
generators. In this format, the details of a procedure are
described by a structure of type unw_dyn_proc_info_t. This
structure contains the following members: <br/>
unw_word_t name_ptr</p>
<p style="margin-left:18%;">The address of a
(human−readable) name of the procedure or 0 if no such
name is available. If non−zero, the string stored at
this address must be ASCII NUL terminated. For source
languages that use name mangling (such as C++ or Java) the
string stored at this address should be the <i>demangled</i>
version of the name.</p>
<p style="margin-left:9%;">unw_word_t handler</p>
<p style="margin-left:18%;">The address of the personality
routine for this procedure. Personality routines are used in
conjunction with exception handling. See the C++ ABI draft
(http://www.codesourcery.com/cxx−abi/) for an overview
and a description of the personality routine. If the
procedure has no personality routine, handler must be set to
0.</p>
<p style="margin-left:9%;">uint32_t flags</p>
<p style="margin-left:18%;">A bitmask of flags. At the
moment, no flags have been defined and this member must be
set to 0.</p>
<p style="margin-left:9%;">unw_dyn_region_info_t
*regions</p>
<p style="margin-left:18%;">A NULL−terminated linked
list of region descriptors. See section ‘‘Region
descriptors’’ below for more details.</p>
<h3>TABLE−INFO FORMAT
<a name="TABLE−INFO FORMAT"></a>
</h3>
<p style="margin-left:9%; margin-top: 1em">This format is
generally used when the dynamically generated code was
derived from static code and the unwind−info for the
dynamic and the static versions are identical. For example,
this format can be useful when loading
statically−generated code into an address−space
in a non−standard fashion (i.e., through some means
other than dlopen()). In this format, the details of a group
of procedures is described by a structure of type
unw_dyn_table_info. This structure contains the following
members: <br/>
unw_word_t name_ptr</p>
<p style="margin-left:18%;">The address of a
(human−readable) name of the procedure or 0 if no such
name is available. If non−zero, the string stored at
this address must be ASCII NUL terminated. For source
languages that use name−mangling (such as C++ or Java)
the string stored at this address should be the
<i>demangled</i> version of the name.</p>
<p style="margin-left:9%;">unw_word_t segbase</p>
<p style="margin-left:18%;">The segment−base value
that needs to be added to the segment−relative values
stored in the unwind−info. The exact meaning of this
value is architecture−specific.</p>
<p style="margin-left:9%;">unw_word_t table_len</p>
<p style="margin-left:18%;">The length of the
unwind−info (table_data) counted in units of words
(unw_word_t).</p>
<p style="margin-left:9%;">unw_word_t table_data</p>
<p style="margin-left:18%;">A pointer to the actual data
encoding the unwind info. The exact format is
architecture−specific (see architecture−specific
sections below).</p>
<h3>REMOTE TABLE−INFO FORMAT
<a name="REMOTE TABLE−INFO FORMAT"></a>
</h3>
<p style="margin-left:9%; margin-top: 1em">The remote
table−info format has the same basic purpose as the
regular table−info format. The only difference is that
when libunwind uses the unwind−info, it will keep the
table data in the target address−space (which may be
remote). Consequently, the type of the table_data member is
unw_word_t rather than a pointer. This implies that
libunwind will have to access the table−data via the
address−space’s access_mem() call−back,
rather than through a direct memory reference.</p>
<p style="margin-left:9%; margin-top: 1em">From the point
of view of a runtime code generator, the remote
table−info format offers no advantage and it is
expected that such generators will describe their procedures
either with the proc−info format or the normal
table−info format. The main reason that the remote
table−info format exists is to enable the
address−space−specific find_proc_info() callback
(see unw_create_addr_space(3libunwind)) to return unwind
tables whose data remains in remote memory. This can speed
up unwinding (e.g., for a debugger) because it reduces the
amount of data that needs to be loaded from remote
memory.</p>
<h2>REGIONS DESCRIPTORS
<a name="REGIONS DESCRIPTORS"></a>
</h2>
<p style="margin-left:9%; margin-top: 1em">A region
descriptor is a variable length structure that describes how
each instruction in the region affects the frame state. Of
course, most instructions in a region usually do not change
the frame state and for those, nothing needs to be recorded
in the region descriptor. A region descriptor is a structure
of type unw_dyn_region_info_t and has the following members:
<br/>
unw_dyn_region_info_t *next</p>
<p style="margin-left:18%;">A pointer to the next region.
If this is the last region, next is NULL.</p>
<p style="margin-left:9%;">int32_t insn_count</p>
<p style="margin-left:18%;">The length of the region in
instructions. Each instruction is assumed to have a fixed
size (see architecture−specific sections for details).
The value of insn_count may be negative in the last region
of a procedure (i.e., it may be negative only if next is
NULL). A negative value indicates that the region covers the
last <i>N</i> instructions of the procedure, where <i>N</i>
is the absolute value of insn_count.</p>
<p style="margin-left:9%;">uint32_t op_count</p>
<p style="margin-left:18%;">The (allocated) length of the
op_count array.</p>
<p style="margin-left:9%;">unw_dyn_op_t op</p>
<p style="margin-left:18%;">An array of dynamic unwind
directives. See Section ‘‘Dynamic unwind
directives’’ for a description of the
directives.</p>
<p style="margin-left:9%; margin-top: 1em">A region
descriptor with an insn_count of zero is an <i>empty
region</i> and such regions are perfectly legal. In fact,
empty regions can be useful to establish a particular frame
state before the start of another region.</p>
<p style="margin-left:9%; margin-top: 1em">A single region
list can be shared across multiple procedures provided those
procedures share a common prologue and epilogue (their
bodies may differ, of course). Normally, such procedures
consist of a canned prologue, the body, and a canned
epilogue. This could be described by two regions: one
covering the prologue and one covering the epilogue. Since
the body length is variable, the latter region would need to
specify a negative value in insn_count such that libunwind
knows that the region covers the end of the procedure (up to
the address specified by end_ip).</p>
<p style="margin-left:9%; margin-top: 1em">The region
descriptor is a variable length structure to make it
possible to allocate all the necessary memory with a single
memory−allocation request. To facilitate the
allocation of a region descriptors libunwind provides a
helper routine with the following synopsis:</p>
<p style="margin-left:9%; margin-top: 1em">size_t
_U_dyn_region_size(int op_count);</p>
<p style="margin-left:9%; margin-top: 1em">This routine
returns the number of bytes needed to hold a region
descriptor with space for op_count unwind directives. Note
that the length of the op array does not have to match
exactly with the number of directives in a region. Instead,
it is sufficient if the op array contains at least as many
entries as there are directives, since the end of the
directives can always be indicated with the UNW_DYN_STOP
directive.</p>
<h2>DYNAMIC UNWIND DIRECTIVES
<a name="DYNAMIC UNWIND DIRECTIVES"></a>
</h2>
<p style="margin-left:9%; margin-top: 1em">A dynamic unwind
directive describes how the frame state changes at a
particular point within a region. The description is in the
form of a structure of type unw_dyn_op_t. This structure has
the following members: <br/>
int8_t tag</p>
<p style="margin-left:18%;">The operation tag. Must be one
of the unw_dyn_operation_t values described below.</p>
<p style="margin-left:9%;">int8_t qp</p>
<p style="margin-left:18%;">The qualifying predicate that
controls whether or not this directive is active. This is
useful for predicated architectures such as IA−64 or
ARM, where the contents of another (callee−saved)
register determines whether or not an instruction is
executed (takes effect). If the directive is always active,
this member should be set to the manifest constant
_U_QP_TRUE (this constant is defined for all architectures,
predicated or not).</p>
<p style="margin-left:9%;">int16_t reg</p>
<p style="margin-left:18%;">The number of the register
affected by the instruction.</p>
<p style="margin-left:9%;">int32_t when</p>
<p style="margin-left:18%;">The region−relative
number of the instruction to which this directive applies.
For example, a value of 0 means that the effect described by
this directive has taken place once the first instruction in
the region has executed.</p>
<p style="margin-left:9%;">unw_word_t val</p>
<p style="margin-left:18%;">The value to be applied by the
operation tag. The exact meaning of this value varies by
tag. See Section ‘‘Operation tags’’
below.</p>
<p style="margin-left:9%; margin-top: 1em">It is perfectly
legitimate to specify multiple dynamic unwind directives
with the same when value, if a particular instruction has a
complex effect on the frame state.</p>
<p style="margin-left:9%; margin-top: 1em">Empty regions by
definition contain no actual instructions and as such the
directives are not tied to a particular instruction. By
convention, the when member should be set to 0, however.</p>
<p style="margin-left:9%; margin-top: 1em">There is no need
for the dynamic unwind directives to appear in order of
increasing when values. If the directives happen to be
sorted in that order, it may result in slightly faster
execution, but a runtime code−generator should not go
to extra lengths just to ensure that the directives are
sorted.</p>
<p style="margin-left:9%; margin-top: 1em">IMPLEMENTATION
NOTE: should libunwind implementations for certain
architectures prefer the list of unwind directives to be
sorted, it is recommended that such implementations first
check whether the list happens to be sorted already and, if
not, sort the directives explicitly before the first use.
With this approach, the overhead of explicit sorting is only
paid when there is a real benefit and if the runtime
code−generator happens to generate sorted lists
naturally, the performance penalty is limited to a simple
O(N) check.</p>
<h3>OPERATIONS TAGS
<a name="OPERATIONS TAGS"></a>
</h3>
<p style="margin-left:9%; margin-top: 1em">The possible
operation tags are defined by enumeration type
unw_dyn_operation_t which defines the following values: <br/>
UNW_DYN_STOP</p>
<p style="margin-left:18%;">Marks the end of the dynamic
unwind directive list. All remaining entries in the op array
of the region−descriptor are ignored. This tag is
guaranteed to have a value of 0.</p>
<p style="margin-left:9%;">UNW_DYN_SAVE_REG</p>
<p style="margin-left:18%;">Marks an instruction which
saves register reg to register val.</p>
<p style="margin-left:9%;">UNW_DYN_SPILL_FP_REL</p>
<p style="margin-left:18%;">Marks an instruction which
spills register reg to a frame−pointer−relative
location. The frame−pointer−relative offset is
given by the value stored in member val. See the
architecture−specific sections for a description of
the stack frame layout.</p>
<p style="margin-left:9%;">UNW_DYN_SPILL_SP_REL</p>
<p style="margin-left:18%;">Marks an instruction which
spills register reg to a stack−pointer−relative
location. The stack−pointer−relative offset is
given by the value stored in member val. See the
architecture−specific sections for a description of
the stack frame layout.</p>
<p style="margin-left:9%;">UNW_DYN_ADD</p>
<p style="margin-left:18%;">Marks an instruction which adds
the constant value val to register reg. To add subtract a
constant value, store the two’s−complement of
the value in val. The set of registers that can be specified
for this tag is described in the architecture−specific
sections below.</p>
