<h2>DIFFERENCES BETWEEN PCRE AND PERL
<a name="DIFFERENCES BETWEEN PCRE AND PERL"></a>
</h2>
<p style="margin-left:9%; margin-top: 1em">This document
describes the differences in the ways that PCRE and Perl
handle regular expressions. The differences described here
are with respect to Perl versions 5.10 and above.</p>
<p style="margin-left:9%; margin-top: 1em">1. PCRE has only
a subset of Perl’s Unicode support. Details of what it
does have are given in the <b>pcreunicode</b> page.</p>
<p style="margin-left:9%; margin-top: 1em">2. PCRE allows
repeat quantifiers only on parenthesized assertions, but
they do not mean what you might think. For example, (?!a){3}
does not assert that the next three characters are not
"a". It just asserts that the next character is
not "a" three times (in principle: PCRE optimizes
this to run the assertion just once). Perl allows repeat
quantifiers on other assertions such as \b, but these do not
seem to have any use.</p>
<p style="margin-left:9%; margin-top: 1em">3. Capturing
subpatterns that occur inside negative lookahead assertions
are counted, but their entries in the offsets vector are
never set. Perl sometimes (but not always) sets its
numerical variables from inside negative assertions.</p>
<p style="margin-left:9%; margin-top: 1em">4. Though binary
zero characters are supported in the subject string, they
are not allowed in a pattern string because it is passed as
a normal C string, terminated by zero. The escape sequence
\0 can be used in the pattern to represent a binary
zero.</p>
<p style="margin-left:9%; margin-top: 1em">5. The following
Perl escape sequences are not supported: \l, \u, \L, \U, and
\N when followed by a character name or Unicode value. (\N
on its own, matching a non-newline character, is supported.)
In fact these are implemented by Perl’s general
string-handling and are not part of its pattern matching
engine. If any of these are encountered by PCRE, an error is
generated by default. However, if the PCRE_JAVASCRIPT_COMPAT
option is set, \U and \u are interpreted as JavaScript
interprets them.</p>
<p style="margin-left:9%; margin-top: 1em">6. The Perl
escape sequences \p, \P, and \X are supported only if PCRE
is built with Unicode character property support. The
properties that can be tested with \p and \P are limited to
the general category properties such as Lu and Nd, script
names such as Greek or Han, and the derived properties Any
and L&amp;. PCRE does support the Cs (surrogate) property,
which Perl does not; the Perl documentation says
"Because Perl hides the need for the user to understand
the internal representation of Unicode characters, there is
no need to implement the somewhat messy concept of
surrogates."</p>
<p style="margin-left:9%; margin-top: 1em">7. PCRE does
support the \Q...\E escape for quoting substrings.
Characters in between are treated as literals. This is
slightly different from Perl in that $ and @ are also
handled as literals inside the quotes. In Perl, they cause
variable interpolation (but of course PCRE does not have
variables). Note the following examples:</p>
<p style="margin-left:9%; margin-top: 1em">Pattern PCRE
matches Perl matches</p>
<p style="margin-left:9%; margin-top: 1em">\Qabc$xyz\E
abc$xyz abc followed by the <br/>
contents of $xyz <br/>
\Qabc\$xyz\E abc\$xyz abc\$xyz <br/>
\Qabc\E\$\Qxyz\E abc$xyz abc$xyz</p>
<p style="margin-left:9%; margin-top: 1em">The \Q...\E
sequence is recognized both inside and outside character
classes.</p>
<p style="margin-left:9%; margin-top: 1em">8. Fairly
obviously, PCRE does not support the (?{code}) and
(??{code}) constructions. However, there is support for
recursive patterns. This is not available in Perl 5.8, but
it is in Perl 5.10. Also, the PCRE "callout"
feature allows an external function to be called during
pattern matching. See the <b>pcrecallout</b> documentation
for details.</p>
<p style="margin-left:9%; margin-top: 1em">9. Subpatterns
that are called as subroutines (whether or not recursively)
are always treated as atomic groups in PCRE. This is like
Python, but unlike Perl. Captured values that are set
outside a subroutine call can be reference from inside in
PCRE, but not in Perl. There is a discussion that explains
these differences in more detail in the section on recursion
differences from Perl in the <b>pcrepattern</b> page.</p>
<p style="margin-left:9%; margin-top: 1em">10. If any of
the backtracking control verbs are used in a subpattern that
is called as a subroutine (whether or not recursively),
their effect is confined to that subpattern; it does not
extend to the surrounding pattern. This is not always the
case in Perl. In particular, if (*THEN) is present in a
group that is called as a subroutine, its action is limited
to that group, even if the group does not contain any |
characters. Note that such subpatterns are processed as
anchored at the point where they are tested.</p>
<p style="margin-left:9%; margin-top: 1em">11. If a pattern
contains more than one backtracking control verb, the first
one that is backtracked onto acts. For example, in the
pattern A(*COMMIT)B(*PRUNE)C a failure in B triggers
(*COMMIT), but a failure in C triggers (*PRUNE).
Perl’s behaviour is more complex; in many cases it is
the same as PCRE, but there are examples where it
differs.</p>
<p style="margin-left:9%; margin-top: 1em">12. Most
backtracking verbs in assertions have their normal actions.
They are not confined to the assertion.</p>
<p style="margin-left:9%; margin-top: 1em">13. There are
some differences that are concerned with the settings of
captured strings when part of a pattern is repeated. For
example, matching "aba" against the pattern
/ˆ(a(b)?)+$/ in Perl leaves $2 unset, but in PCRE it is
set to "b".</p>
<p style="margin-left:9%; margin-top: 1em">14. PCRE’s
handling of duplicate subpattern numbers and duplicate
subpattern names is not as general as Perl’s. This is
a consequence of the fact the PCRE works internally just
with numbers, using an external table to translate between
numbers and names. In particular, a pattern such as
(?|(?&lt;a&gt;A)|(?&lt;b&gt;B), where the two capturing
parentheses have the same number but different names, is not
supported, and causes an error at compile time. If it were
allowed, it would not be possible to distinguish which
parentheses matched, because both names map to capturing
subpattern number 1. To avoid this confusing situation, an
error is given at compile time.</p>
<p style="margin-left:9%; margin-top: 1em">15. Perl
recognizes comments in some places that PCRE does not, for
example, between the ( and ? at the start of a subpattern.
If the /x modifier is set, Perl allows white space between (
and ? (though current Perls warn that this is deprecated)
but PCRE never does, even if the PCRE_EXTENDED option is
set.</p>
<p style="margin-left:9%; margin-top: 1em">16. Perl, when
in warning mode, gives warnings for character classes such
as [A-\d] or [a-[:digit:]]. It then treats the hyphens as
literals. PCRE has no warning features, so it gives an error
in these cases because they are almost certainly user
mistakes.</p>
<p style="margin-left:9%; margin-top: 1em">17. In PCRE, the
upper/lower case character properties Lu and Ll are not
affected when case-independent matching is specified. For
example, \p{Lu} always matches an upper case letter. I think
Perl has changed in this respect; in the release at the time
of writing (5.16), \p{Lu} and \p{Ll} match all letters,
regardless of case, when case independence is specified.</p>
<p style="margin-left:9%; margin-top: 1em">18. PCRE
provides some extensions to the Perl regular expression
facilities. Perl 5.10 includes new features that are not in
earlier versions of Perl, some of which (such as named
parentheses) have been in PCRE for some time. This list is
with respect to Perl 5.10:</p>
<p style="margin-left:9%; margin-top: 1em">(a) Although
lookbehind assertions in PCRE must match fixed length
strings, each alternative branch of a lookbehind assertion
can match a different length of string. Perl requires them
all to have the same length.</p>
<p style="margin-left:9%; margin-top: 1em">(b) If
PCRE_DOLLAR_ENDONLY is set and PCRE_MULTILINE is not set,
the $ meta-character matches only at the very end of the
string.</p>
<p style="margin-left:9%; margin-top: 1em">(c) If
PCRE_EXTRA is set, a backslash followed by a letter with no
special meaning is faulted. Otherwise, like Perl, the
backslash is quietly ignored. (Perl can be made to issue a
warning.)</p>
<p style="margin-left:9%; margin-top: 1em">(d) If
PCRE_UNGREEDY is set, the greediness of the repetition
quantifiers is inverted, that is, by default they are not
greedy, but if followed by a question mark they are.</p>
<p style="margin-left:9%; margin-top: 1em">(e)
PCRE_ANCHORED can be used at matching time to force a
pattern to be tried only at the first matching position in
the subject string.</p>
<p style="margin-left:9%; margin-top: 1em">(f) The
PCRE_NOTBOL, PCRE_NOTEOL, PCRE_NOTEMPTY,
PCRE_NOTEMPTY_ATSTART, and PCRE_NO_AUTO_CAPTURE options for
<b>pcre_exec()</b> have no Perl equivalents.</p>
<p style="margin-left:9%; margin-top: 1em">(g) The \R
escape sequence can be restricted to match only CR, LF, or
CRLF by the PCRE_BSR_ANYCRLF option.</p>
<p style="margin-left:9%; margin-top: 1em">(h) The callout
facility is PCRE-specific.</p>
<p style="margin-left:9%; margin-top: 1em">(i) The partial
matching facility is PCRE-specific.</p>
<p style="margin-left:9%; margin-top: 1em">(j) Patterns
compiled by PCRE can be saved and re-used at a later time,
even on different hosts that have the other endianness.
However, this does not apply to optimized data created by
the just-in-time compiler.</p>
<p style="margin-left:9%; margin-top: 1em">(k) The
alternative matching functions (<b>pcre_dfa_exec()</b>,
<b>pcre16_dfa_exec()</b> and <b>pcre32_dfa_exec()</b>,)
match in a different way and are not Perl-compatible.</p>
<p style="margin-left:9%; margin-top: 1em">(l) PCRE
recognizes some special sequences such as (*CR) at the start
of a pattern that set overall options that cannot be changed
within the pattern.</p>
