<h2>NAME
<a name="NAME"></a>
</h2>
<p style="margin-left:9%; margin-top: 1em">PCRE -
Perl-compatible regular expressions</p>
<h2>UTF-8, UTF-16, UTF-32, AND UNICODE PROPERTY SUPPORT
<a name="UTF-8, UTF-16, UTF-32, AND UNICODE PROPERTY SUPPORT"></a>
</h2>
<p style="margin-left:9%; margin-top: 1em">As well as UTF-8
support, PCRE also supports UTF-16 (from release 8.30) and
UTF-32 (from release 8.32), by means of two additional
libraries. They can be built as well as, or instead of, the
8-bit library.</p>
<h2>UTF-8 SUPPORT
<a name="UTF-8 SUPPORT"></a>
</h2>
<p style="margin-left:9%; margin-top: 1em">In order process
UTF-8 strings, you must build PCRE’s 8-bit library
with UTF support, and, in addition, you must call
<b>pcre_compile()</b> with the PCRE_UTF8 option flag, or the
pattern must start with the sequence (*UTF8) or (*UTF). When
either of these is the case, both the pattern and any
subject strings that are matched against it are treated as
UTF-8 strings instead of strings of individual 1-byte
characters.</p>
<h2>UTF-16 AND UTF-32 SUPPORT
<a name="UTF-16 AND UTF-32 SUPPORT"></a>
</h2>
<p style="margin-left:9%; margin-top: 1em">In order process
UTF-16 or UTF-32 strings, you must build PCRE’s 16-bit
or 32-bit library with UTF support, and, in addition, you
must call <b>pcre16_compile()</b> or <b>pcre32_compile()</b>
with the PCRE_UTF16 or PCRE_UTF32 option flag, as
appropriate. Alternatively, the pattern must start with the
sequence (*UTF16), (*UTF32), as appropriate, or (*UTF),
which can be used with either library. When UTF mode is set,
both the pattern and any subject strings that are matched
against it are treated as UTF-16 or UTF-32 strings instead
of strings of individual 16-bit or 32-bit characters.</p>
<h2>UTF SUPPORT OVERHEAD
<a name="UTF SUPPORT OVERHEAD"></a>
</h2>
<p style="margin-left:9%; margin-top: 1em">If you compile
PCRE with UTF support, but do not use it at run time, the
library will be a bit bigger, but the additional run time
overhead is limited to testing the PCRE_UTF[8|16|32] flag
occasionally, so should not be very big.</p>
<h2>UNICODE PROPERTY SUPPORT
<a name="UNICODE PROPERTY SUPPORT"></a>
</h2>
<p style="margin-left:9%; margin-top: 1em">If PCRE is built
with Unicode character property support (which implies UTF
support), the escape sequences \p{..}, \P{..}, and \X can be
used. The available properties that can be tested are
limited to the general category properties such as Lu for an
upper case letter or Nd for a decimal number, the Unicode
script names such as Arabic or Han, and the derived
properties Any and L&amp;. Full lists is given in the
<b>pcrepattern</b> and <b>pcresyntax</b> documentation. Only
the short names for properties are supported. For example,
\p{L} matches a letter. Its Perl synonym, \p{Letter}, is not
supported. Furthermore, in Perl, many properties may
optionally be prefixed by "Is", for compatibility
with Perl 5.6. PCRE does not support this.</p>
<h3>Validity of UTF-8 strings
<a name="Validity of UTF-8 strings"></a>
</h3>
<p style="margin-left:9%; margin-top: 1em">When you set the
PCRE_UTF8 flag, the byte strings passed as patterns and
subjects are (by default) checked for validity on entry to
the relevant functions. The entire string is checked before
any other processing takes place. From release 7.3 of PCRE,
the check is according the rules of RFC 3629, which are
themselves derived from the Unicode specification. Earlier
releases of PCRE followed the rules of RFC 2279, which
allows the full range of 31-bit values (0 to 0x7FFFFFFF).
The current check allows only values in the range U+0 to
U+10FFFF, excluding the surrogate area. (From release 8.33
the so-called "non-character" code points are no
longer excluded because Unicode corrigendum #9 makes it
clear that they should not be.)</p>
<p style="margin-left:9%; margin-top: 1em">Characters in
the "Surrogate Area" of Unicode are reserved for
use by UTF-16, where they are used in pairs to encode
codepoints with values greater than 0xFFFF. The code points
that are encoded by UTF-16 pairs are available independently
in the UTF-8 and UTF-32 encodings. (In other words, the
whole surrogate thing is a fudge for UTF-16 which
unfortunately messes up UTF-8 and UTF-32.)</p>
<p style="margin-left:9%; margin-top: 1em">If an invalid
UTF-8 string is passed to PCRE, an error return is given. At
compile time, the only additional information is the offset
to the first byte of the failing character. The run-time
functions <b>pcre_exec()</b> and <b>pcre_dfa_exec()</b> also
pass back this information, as well as a more detailed
reason code if the caller has provided memory in which to do
this.</p>
<p style="margin-left:9%; margin-top: 1em">In some
situations, you may already know that your strings are
valid, and therefore want to skip these checks in order to
improve performance, for example in the case of a long
subject string that is being scanned repeatedly. If you set
the PCRE_NO_UTF8_CHECK flag at compile time or at run time,
PCRE assumes that the pattern or subject it is given
(respectively) contains only valid UTF-8 codes. In this
case, it does not diagnose an invalid UTF-8 string.</p>
<p style="margin-left:9%; margin-top: 1em">Note that
passing PCRE_NO_UTF8_CHECK to <b>pcre_compile()</b> just
disables the check for the pattern; it does not also apply
to subject strings. If you want to disable the check for a
subject string you must pass this option to
<b>pcre_exec()</b> or <b>pcre_dfa_exec()</b>.</p>
<p style="margin-left:9%; margin-top: 1em">If you pass an
invalid UTF-8 string when PCRE_NO_UTF8_CHECK is set, the
result is undefined and your program may crash.</p>
<h3>Validity of UTF-16 strings
<a name="Validity of UTF-16 strings"></a>
</h3>
<p style="margin-left:9%; margin-top: 1em">When you set the
PCRE_UTF16 flag, the strings of 16-bit data units that are
passed as patterns and subjects are (by default) checked for
validity on entry to the relevant functions. Values other
than those in the surrogate range U+D800 to U+DFFF are
independent code points. Values in the surrogate range must
be used in pairs in the correct manner.</p>
<p style="margin-left:9%; margin-top: 1em">If an invalid
UTF-16 string is passed to PCRE, an error return is given.
At compile time, the only additional information is the
offset to the first data unit of the failing character. The
run-time functions <b>pcre16_exec()</b> and
<b>pcre16_dfa_exec()</b> also pass back this information, as
well as a more detailed reason code if the caller has
provided memory in which to do this.</p>
<p style="margin-left:9%; margin-top: 1em">In some

improve performance. If you set the PCRE_NO_UTF16_CHECK flag
at compile time or at run time, PCRE assumes that the
pattern or subject it is given (respectively) contains only
valid UTF-16 sequences. In this case, it does not diagnose
an invalid UTF-16 string. However, if an invalid string is
passed, the result is undefined.</p>
<h3>Validity of UTF-32 strings
<a name="Validity of UTF-32 strings"></a>
</h3>
<p style="margin-left:9%; margin-top: 1em">When you set the
PCRE_UTF32 flag, the strings of 32-bit data units that are
passed as patterns and subjects are (by default) checked for
validity on entry to the relevant functions. This check
allows only values in the range U+0 to U+10FFFF, excluding
the surrogate area U+D800 to U+DFFF.</p>
<p style="margin-left:9%; margin-top: 1em">If an invalid
UTF-32 string is passed to PCRE, an error return is given.
At compile time, the only additional information is the
offset to the first data unit of the failing character. The
run-time functions <b>pcre32_exec()</b> and

<h3>General comments about UTF modes
<a name="General comments about UTF modes"></a>
</h3>
<p style="margin-left:9%; margin-top: 1em">1. Codepoints
less than 256 can be specified in patterns by either braced
or unbraced hexadecimal escape sequences (for example,
\x{b3} or \xb3). Larger values have to use braced
sequences.</p>
<p style="margin-left:9%; margin-top: 1em">2. Octal numbers
up to \777 are recognized, and in UTF-8 mode they match
two-byte characters for values greater than \177.</p>
<p style="margin-left:9%; margin-top: 1em">3. Repeat
quantifiers apply to complete UTF characters, not to
individual data units, for example: \x{100}{3}.</p>
<p style="margin-left:9%; margin-top: 1em">4. The dot
metacharacter matches one UTF character instead of a single
data unit.</p>
<p style="margin-left:9%; margin-top: 1em">5. The escape
sequence \C can be used to match a single byte in UTF-8
mode, or a single 16-bit data unit in UTF-16 mode, or a
single 32-bit data unit in UTF-32 mode, but its use can lead
to some strange effects because it breaks up multi-unit
characters (see the description of \C in the
<b>pcrepattern</b> documentation). The use of \C is not
supported in the alternative matching function
<b>pcre[16|32]_dfa_exec()</b>, nor is it supported in UTF
mode by the JIT optimization of <b>pcre[16|32]_exec()</b>.
If JIT optimization is requested for a UTF pattern that
contains \C, it will not succeed, and so the matching will
be carried out by the normal interpretive function.</p>
<p style="margin-left:9%; margin-top: 1em">6. The character
escapes \b, \B, \d, \D, \s, \S, \w, and \W correctly test
characters of any code value, but, by default, the
characters that PCRE recognizes as digits, spaces, or word
characters remain the same set as in non-UTF mode, all with
values less than 256. This remains true even when PCRE is
built to include Unicode property support, because to do
otherwise would slow down PCRE in many common cases. Note in
particular that this applies to \b and \B, because they are
defined in terms of \w and \W. If you really want to test
for a wider sense of, say, "digit", you can use
explicit Unicode property tests such as \p{Nd}.
Alternatively, if you set the PCRE_UCP option, the way that
the character escapes work is changed so that Unicode
properties are used to determine which characters match.
There are more details in the section on generic character
types in the <b>pcrepattern</b> documentation.</p>
<p style="margin-left:9%; margin-top: 1em">7. Similarly,
characters that match the POSIX named character classes are
all low-valued characters, unless the PCRE_UCP option is
set.</p>
<p style="margin-left:9%; margin-top: 1em">8. However, the
horizontal and vertical white space matching escapes (\h,
\H, \v, and \V) do match all the appropriate Unicode
characters, whether or not PCRE_UCP is set.</p>
<p style="margin-left:9%; margin-top: 1em">9.
Case-insensitive matching applies only to characters whose
values are less than 128, unless PCRE is built with Unicode
property support. A few Unicode characters such as Greek
sigma have more than two codepoints that are
case-equivalent. Up to and including PCRE release 8.31, only
one-to-one case mappings were supported, but later releases
(with Unicode property support) do treat as case-equivalent
all versions of characters such as Greek sigma.</p>
