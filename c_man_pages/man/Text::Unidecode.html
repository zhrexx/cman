<h2>NAME

</h2>
<p style="margin-left:9%; margin-top: 1em">Text::Unidecode
−− plain ASCII transliterations of Unicode
text</p>
<h2>SYNOPSIS
<a name="SYNOPSIS"></a>
</h2>
<p style="margin-left:9%; margin-top: 1em">use utf8; <br/>
use Text::Unidecode; <br/>
print unidecode( <br/>
"北 亰 \n" <br/>
# Chinese characters for Beijing (U+5317 U+4EB0) <br/>
); <br/>
# That prints: Bei Jing</p>
<h2>DESCRIPTION
<a name="DESCRIPTION"></a>
</h2>
<p style="margin-left:9%; margin-top: 1em">It often happens
that you have non−Roman text data in Unicode, but you
can't display it−− usually because you're trying
to show it to a user via an application that doesn't support
Unicode, or because the fonts you need aren't accessible.
You could represent the Unicode characters as
"???????" or "\15BA\15A0\1610...", but
that's nearly useless to the user who actually wants to read
what the text says.</p>
<p style="margin-left:9%; margin-top: 1em">What
Text::Unidecode provides is a function, unidecode(...) that
takes Unicode data and tries to represent it in
US−ASCII characters (i.e., the universally displayable
characters between 0x00 and 0x7F). The representation is
almost always an attempt at
<i>transliteration</i>−− i.e., conveying, in
Roman letters, the pronunciation expressed by the text in
some other writing system. (See the example in the
synopsis.)</p>
<p style="margin-left:9%; margin-top: 1em">NOTE:</p>
<p style="margin-left:9%; margin-top: 1em">To make sure
your perldoc/Pod viewing setup for viewing this page is
working: The six−letter word
"résumé" should look like
"resume" with an "/" accent on each
"e".</p>
<p style="margin-left:9%; margin-top: 1em">For further
tests, and help if that doesn't work, see below, "A POD
ENCODING TEST".</p>
<h2>DESIGN PHILOSOPHY
<a name="DESIGN PHILOSOPHY"></a>
</h2>
<p style="margin-left:9%; margin-top: 1em">Unidecode's
ability to transliterate from a given language is limited by
two factors:</p>
<table border="0" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" frame="void" rules="none" width="100%">
<tr align="left" valign="top">
<td width="9%"></td>
<td width="1%">
<p>•</p></td>
<td width="4%"></td>
<td width="85%">
<p>The amount and quality of data in the written form of
the original language</p></td>
<td width="1%">
</td></tr>
</table>
<p style="margin-left:14%; margin-top: 1em">So if you have
Hebrew data that has no vowel points in it, then Unidecode
cannot guess what vowels should appear in a pronunciation. S
f y hv n vwls n th npt, y wn't gt ny vwls n th tpt. (This is
a specific application of the general principle of
"Garbage In, Garbage Out".)</p>
<table border="0" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" frame="void" rules="none" width="100%">
<tr align="left" valign="top">
<td width="9%"></td>
<td width="1%">
<p style="margin-top: 1em">•</p></td>
<td width="4%"></td>
<td width="53%">
<p style="margin-top: 1em">Basic limitations in the
Unidecode design</p></td>
<td width="33%">
</td></tr>
</table>
<p style="margin-left:14%; margin-top: 1em">Writing a real
and clever transliteration algorithm for any single language
usually requires a lot of time, and at least a passable
knowledge of the language involved. But Unicode text can
convey more languages than I could possibly learn (much less
create a transliterator for) in the entire rest of my
lifetime. So I put a cap on how intelligent Unidecode could
be, by insisting that it support only
context−<i>in</i>sensitive transliteration. That means
missing the finer details of any given writing system, while
still hopefully being useful.</p>
<p style="margin-left:9%; margin-top: 1em">Unidecode, in
other words, is quick and dirty. Sometimes the output is not
so dirty at all: Russian and Greek seem to work passably;
and while Thaana (Divehi, AKA Maldivian) is a definitely
non−Western writing system, setting up a mapping from
it to Roman letters seems to work pretty well. But sometimes
the output is <i>very dirty:</i> Unidecode does quite badly
on Japanese and Thai.</p>
<p style="margin-left:9%; margin-top: 1em">If you want a
smarter transliteration for a particular language than
Unidecode provides, then you should look for (or write) a
transliteration algorithm specific to that language, and
apply it instead of (or at least before) applying
Unidecode.</p>
<p style="margin-left:9%; margin-top: 1em">In other words,
Unidecode's approach is broad (knowing about dozens of
writing systems), but shallow (not being meticulous about
any of them).</p>
<h2>FUNCTIONS
<a name="FUNCTIONS"></a>
</h2>
<p style="margin-left:9%; margin-top: 1em">Text::Unidecode
provides one function, unidecode(...), which is exported by
default. It can be used in a variety of calling contexts:
<br/>
"$out = unidecode( $in );" # scalar context</p>
<p style="margin-left:14%;">This returns a copy of $in,
transliterated.</p>
<p style="margin-left:9%;">"$out = unidecode( @in
);" # scalar context</p>
<p style="margin-left:14%;">This is the same as "$out
= unidecode(join "", @in);"</p>
<p style="margin-left:9%;">"@out = unidecode( @in
);" # list context</p>
<p style="margin-left:14%;">This returns a list consisting
of copies of @in, each transliterated. This is the same as
"@out = map scalar(unidecode($_)), @in;"</p>
<p style="margin-left:9%;">"unidecode( @items );"
# void context <br/>
"unidecode( @bar, $foo, @baz );" # void
context</p>
<p style="margin-left:14%;">Each item on input is replaced
with its transliteration. This is the same as
"for(@bar, $foo, @baz) { $_ = unidecode($_) }"</p>
<p style="margin-left:9%; margin-top: 1em">You should make
a minimum of assumptions about the output of unidecode(...).
For example, if you assume an all−alphabetic (Unicode)
string passed to unidecode(...) will return an
all−alphabetic string, you're wrong−− some
alphabetic Unicode characters are transliterated as strings
containing punctuation (e.g., the Armenian letter
"Թ" (U+0539), currently transliterates as
"T`" (capital−T then a backtick).</p>
<p style="margin-left:9%; margin-top: 1em">However, these
are the assumptions you <i>can</i> make:</p>
<table border="0" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" frame="void" rules="none" width="100%">
<tr align="left" valign="top">
<td width="9%"></td>
<td width="1%">
<p>•</p></td>
<td width="4%"></td>
<td width="85%">
<p>Each character 0x0000 − 0x007F transliterates as
itself. That is, unidecode(...) is 7−bit pure.</p></td>

</td></tr>
<tr align="left" valign="top">
<td width="9%"></td>
<td width="1%">
<p>•</p></td>
<td width="4%"></td>

0x0000 − 0x007F.</p></td>

<td width="9%"></td>

<p>All Unicode characters translate to a sequence of (any
number of) characters that are newline ("\n") or
in the range 0x0020−0x007E. That is, no Unicode
character translates to "\x01", for example.
(Although if you have a "\x01" on input, you'll
get a "\x01" in output.)</p></td>
<td width="1%">
</td></tr>
<tr align="left" valign="top">
<td width="9%"></td>
<td width="1%">
<p>•</p></td>
<td width="4%"></td>
<td width="85%">
<p>Yes, some transliterations produce a "\n" but
it's just a few, and only with good reason. Note that the

</td></tr>
<tr align="left" valign="top">
<td width="9%"></td>
<td width="1%">

</td></tr>
<tr align="left" valign="top">
<td width="9%"></td>
<td width="1%">
<p>•</p></td>
<td width="4%"></td>
<td width="85%">
<p>Very many Unicode characters transliterate to
multi−character sequences. E.g., Unihan character
U+5317, "北 ", transliterates as the
four−character string "Bei ".</p></td>
<td width="1%">
</td></tr>
<tr align="left" valign="top">
<td width="9%"></td>
<td width="1%">
<p>•</p></td>
<td width="4%"></td>
<td width="85%">
<p>Within these constraints, <i>I may change</i> the
transliteration of characters in future versions. For
example, if someone convinces me that that the Armenian
letter "Թ", currently transliterated as
"T`", would be better transliterated as
"D", I <i>may</i> well make that change.</p></td>

<tr align="left" valign="top">
<td width="9%"></td>
<td width="1%">
<p>•</p></td>
<td width="4%"></td>
<td width="85%">
<p>Unfortunately, there are many characters that Unidecode
doesn't know a transliteration for. This is generally
because the character has been added since I last revised
the Unidecode data tables. I'm <i>always</i> catching
up!</p> </td>

<h2>DESIGN GOALS AND CONSTRAINTS
<a name="DESIGN GOALS AND CONSTRAINTS"></a>
</h2>
<p style="margin-left:9%; margin-top: 1em">Text::Unidecode
is meant to be a transliterator of last resort, to be used
once you've decided that you can't just display the Unicode
data as is, <i>and once you've decided you don't have a more
clever, language−specific transliterator
available,</i> or once you've <i>already applied</i> smarter
algorithms or mappings that you prefer and you now just want
Unidecode to do cleanup.</p>
<p style="margin-left:9%; margin-top: 1em">Unidecode
transliterates context−insensitively−−
that is, a given character is replaced with the same
US−ASCII (7−bit ASCII) character or characters,
no matter what the surrounding characters are.</p>
<p style="margin-left:9%; margin-top: 1em">The main reason
I'm making Text::Unidecode work with only
context−insensitive substitution is that it's fast,
dumb, and straightforward enough to be feasible. It doesn't
tax my (quite limited) knowledge of world languages. It
doesn't require me writing a hundred lines of code to get
the Thai syllabification right (and never knowing whether
I've gotten it wrong, because I don't know Thai), or
spending a year trying to get Text::Unidecode to use the
ChaSen algorithm for Japanese, or trying to write heuristics
for telling the difference between Japanese, Chinese, or
Korean, so it knows how to transliterate any given
Uni−Han glyph. And moreover, context−insensitive
substitution is still mostly useful, but still clearly
couldn't be mistaken for authoritative.</p>
<p style="margin-left:9%; margin-top: 1em">Text::Unidecode
is an example of the 80/20 rule in action−− you
get 80% of the usefulness using just 20% of a
"real" solution.</p>
<p style="margin-left:9%; margin-top: 1em">A
"real" approach to transliteration for any given
language can involve such increasingly tricky contextual
factors as these: <br/>
The previous / preceding character(s)</p>
<p style="margin-left:14%;">What a given symbol
"X" means, could depend on whether it's followed
by a consonant, or by vowel, or by some diacritic
character.</p>
<p style="margin-left:9%;">Syllables</p>
<p style="margin-left:14%;">A character "X" at
end of a syllable could mean something different from when
it's at the start−− which is especially
problematic when the language involved doesn't explicitly
mark where one syllable stops and the next starts.</p>
<p style="margin-left:9%;">Parts of speech</p>
<p style="margin-left:14%;">What "X" sounds like
at the end of a word, depends on whether that word is a
noun, or a verb, or what.</p>
<p style="margin-left:9%;">Meaning</p>
<p style="margin-left:14%;">By semantic context, you can
tell that this ideogram "X" means "shoe"
(pronounced one way) and not "time" (pronounced
another), and that's how you know to transliterate it one
way instead of the other.</p>
<p style="margin-left:9%;">Origin of the word</p>
<p style="margin-left:14%;">"X" means one thing
in loanwords and/or placenames (and derivatives thereof),
and another in native words.</p>
<p style="margin-left:9%;">"It's just that
way"</p>
<p style="margin-left:14%;">"X" normally makes
the /X/ sound, except for this list of seventy exceptions
(and words based on them, sometimes indirectly). Or: you
never can tell which of the three ways to pronounce
"X" this word actually uses; you just have to know
which it is, so keep a dictionary on hand!</p>
<p style="margin-left:9%;">Language</p>
<p style="margin-left:14%;">The character "X" is
actually used in several different languages, and you have
to figure out which you're looking at before you can
determine how to transliterate it.</p>
<p style="margin-left:9%; margin-top: 1em">Out of a desire
to avoid being mired in <i>any</i> of these kinds of
contextual factors, I chose to exclude <i>all of them</i>
and just stick with context−insensitive
replacement.</p>

<p style="margin-left:9%; margin-top: 1em">Lots:</p>
<p style="margin-left:9%; margin-top: 1em">* Rebuild the

<p style="margin-left:9%; margin-top: 1em">* Add
tone−numbers for Mandarin hanzi? Namely: In Unihan,
when tone marks are present (like in "kMandarin:
dào", should I continue to transliterate as just
"Dao", or should I put in the tone number:
"Dao4"? It would be pretty jarring to have digits
appear where previously there was just alphabetic
stuff−− But tone numbers make Chinese more
readable. (I have a clever idea about doing this, for
Unidecode v2 or v3.)</p>

<i>both</i> meanings: 1) seeing the output of unidecode(...)
is better than just having all font−unavailable
Unicode characters replaced with "?"'s, or
rendered as gibberish; and 2) it's the worst, i.e., there's
nothing that Text::Unidecode's algorithm is better than. All
sensible transliteration algorithms (like for German, see
below) are going to be smarter than Unidecode's.</p>
<h2>WHEN YOU DON'T LIKE WHAT UNIDECODE DOES
<a name="WHEN YOU DON'T LIKE WHAT UNIDECODE DOES"></a>
</h2>
<p style="margin-left:9%; margin-top: 1em">I will repeat
the above, because some people miss it:</p>
<p style="margin-left:9%; margin-top: 1em">Text::Unidecode
is meant to be a transliterator of <i>last resort,</i> to be
used once you've decided that you can't just display the
Unicode data as is, <i>and once you've decided you don't
have a more clever, language−specific transliterator
available</i>−− or once you've <i>already
applied</i> a smarter algorithm and now just want Unidecode
to do cleanup.</p>
<p style="margin-left:9%; margin-top: 1em">In other words,
when you don't like what Unidecode does, <i>do it
yourself.</i> Really, that's what the above says. Here's how
you would do this for German, for example:</p>
<p style="margin-left:9%; margin-top: 1em">In German,
there's the typographical convention that an umlaut (the
double−dots on: ä ö ü) can be written
as an "−e", like with "Schön"
becoming "Schoen". But Unidecode doesn't do
that−− I have Unidecode simply drop the umlaut
accent and give back "Schon".</p>
<p style="margin-left:9%; margin-top: 1em">(I chose this
not because I'm a big meanie, but because <i>generally</i>
changing "ü" to "ue" is disastrous
for all text that's <i>not in German</i>. Finnish
"Hyvää päivää" would turn
into "Hyvaeae paeivaeae". And I discourage you
from being <i>yet another</i> German who emails me, trying
to impel me to consider a typographical nicety of German to
be more important than <i>all other languages</i>.)</p>
<p style="margin-left:9%; margin-top: 1em">If you know that
the text you're handling is probably in German, and you want
to apply the "umlaut becomes −e" rule,
here's how to do it for yourself (and then use Unidecode as
<i>the fallback</i> afterwards):</p>
<p style="margin-left:9%; margin-top: 1em">use utf8; #
&lt;−− probably necessary. <br/>
our( %German_Characters ) = qw( <br/>
Ä AE ä ae <br/>
Ö OE ö oe <br/>
Ü UE ü ue <br/>
ß ss <br/>
); <br/>
use Text::Unidecode qw(unidecode); <br/>
sub german_to_ascii { <br/>
my($german_text) = @_; <br/>
$german_text =˜ <br/>

s/([ÄäÖöÜüß])/$German_Characters{$1}/g;
<br/>
# And now, as a *fallthrough*: <br/>
$german_text = unidecode( $german_text ); <br/>
return $german_text; <br/>
}</p>
<p style="margin-left:9%; margin-top: 1em">To pick another
example, here's something that's not about a specific
language, but simply having a preference that may or may not
agree with Unidecode's (i.e., mine). Consider the
"¥" symbol. Unidecode changes that to
"Y=". If you want "¥" as
"YEN", then...</p>
<p style="margin-left:9%; margin-top: 1em">use
Text::Unidecode qw(unidecode); <br/>
sub my_favorite_unidecode { <br/>
my($text) = @_; <br/>
$text =˜ s/¥/YEN/g; <br/>
# ...and anything else you like, such as: <br/>
$text =˜ s/€/Euro/g; <br/>
# And then, as a fallback,... <br/>
$text = unidecode($text); <br/>
return $text; <br/>
}</p>
<p style="margin-left:9%; margin-top: 1em">Then if you
do:</p>
<p style="margin-left:9%; margin-top: 1em">print
my_favorite_unidecode("You just won ¥250,000 and
€40,000!!!");</p>
<p style="margin-left:9%; margin-top: 1em">...you'll
get:</p>
<p style="margin-left:9%; margin-top: 1em">You just won
YEN250,000 and Euro40,000!!!</p>
<p style="margin-left:9%; margin-top: 1em">...just as you
like it.</p>
<p style="margin-left:9%; margin-top: 1em">(By the way, the
reason <i>I</i> don't have Unidecode just turn
"¥" into "YEN" is that the same
symbol also stands for yuan, the Chinese currency. A
"Y=" is nicely, <i>safely</i> neutral as to
whether we're talking about yen or yuan−− Japan,
or China.)</p>
<p style="margin-left:9%; margin-top: 1em">Another example:
for hanzi/kanji/hanja, I have designed Unidecode to
transliterate according to the value that that character has
in Mandarin (otherwise Cantonese,...). Some users have
complained that applying Unidecode to Japanese produces
gibberish.</p>
<p style="margin-left:9%; margin-top: 1em">To make a long
story short: transliterating from Japanese is
<i>difficult</i> and it requires a <i>lot</i> of
context−sensitivity. If you have text that you're
fairly sure is in Japanese, you're going to have to use a
Japanese−specific algorithm to transliterate Japanese
into ASCII. (And then you can call Unidecode on the output
from that−− it is useful for, for example,
turning ｆ ｕ ｌ ｌ ｗ
ｉ ｄ ｔ ｈ characters into their
normal (ASCII) forms.</p>
<p style="margin-left:9%; margin-top: 1em">(Note, as of
August 2016: I have titanic but tentative plans for making
the value of Unihan characters be something you could set
parameters for at runtime, in changing the order of
"Mandarin else Cantonese else..." in the value
retrieval. Currently that preference list is hardwired on my
end, at module−build time. Other options I'm
considering allowing for: whether the Mandarin and Cantonese
values should have the tone numbers on them; whether every
Unihan value should have a terminal space; and maybe other
clever stuff I haven't thought of yet.)</p>
<h2>CAVEATS
<a name="CAVEATS"></a>
</h2>
<p style="margin-left:9%; margin-top: 1em">If you get
really implausible nonsense out of unidecode(...), make sure
that the input data really is a utf8 string. See perlunicode
and perlunitut.</p>
<p style="margin-left:9%; margin-top: 1em"><i>Unidecode
will work disastrously bad on Japanese.</i> That's because
Japanese is very very hard. To extend the Unidecode motto,
Unidecode is better than nothing, and with Japanese, <i>just
barely!</i></p>
<p style="margin-left:9%; margin-top: 1em">On pure
Mandarin, Unidecode will frequently give odd
values−− that's because a single hanzi can have
several readings, and Unidecode only knows what the Unihan
database says is the most common one.</p>

Unidecode's implementation.</p>
<p style="margin-left:9%; margin-top: 1em">And thank you to
the many people who have encouraged me to plug away at this

of Unidecode. I am told that actually my figure was missing
some zeroes on the end!</p>
