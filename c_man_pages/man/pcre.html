<h2>NAME
<a name="NAME"></a>
</h2>
<p style="margin-left:9%; margin-top: 1em">PCRE -
Perl-compatible regular expressions (original API)</p>
<h2>PLEASE TAKE NOTE
<a name="PLEASE TAKE NOTE"></a>
</h2>
<p style="margin-left:9%; margin-top: 1em">This document
relates to PCRE releases that use the original API, with
library names libpcre, libpcre16, and libpcre32. January
2015 saw the first release of a new API, known as PCRE2,
with release numbers starting at 10.00 and library names
libpcre2-8, libpcre2-16, and libpcre2-32. The old libraries
(now called PCRE1) are now at end of life, and 8.45 is the
final release. New projects are advised to use the new PCRE2
libraries.</p>
<h2>INTRODUCTION
<a name="INTRODUCTION"></a>
</h2>
<p style="margin-left:9%; margin-top: 1em">The PCRE library
is a set of functions that implement regular expression
pattern matching using the same syntax and semantics as
Perl, with just a few differences. Some features that
appeared in Python and PCRE before they appeared in Perl are
also available using the Python syntax, there is some
support for one or two .NET and Oniguruma syntax items, and
there is an option for requesting some minor changes that
give better JavaScript compatibility.</p>
<p style="margin-left:9%; margin-top: 1em">Starting with
release 8.30, it is possible to compile two separate PCRE
libraries: the original, which supports 8-bit character
strings (including UTF-8 strings), and a second library that
supports 16-bit character strings (including UTF-16
strings). The build process allows either one or both to be
built. The majority of the work to make this possible was
done by Zoltan Herczeg.</p>
<p style="margin-left:9%; margin-top: 1em">Starting with
release 8.32 it is possible to compile a third separate PCRE
library that supports 32-bit character strings (including
UTF-32 strings). The build process allows any combination of
the 8-, 16- and 32-bit libraries. The work to make this
possible was done by Christian Persch.</p>
<p style="margin-left:9%; margin-top: 1em">The three
libraries contain identical sets of functions, except that
the names in the 16-bit library start with <b>pcre16_</b>
instead of <b>pcre_</b>, and the names in the 32-bit library
start with <b>pcre32_</b> instead of <b>pcre_</b>. To avoid
over-complication and reduce the documentation maintenance
load, most of the documentation describes the 8-bit library,
with the differences for the 16-bit and 32-bit libraries
described separately in the <b>pcre16</b> and <b>pcre32</b>
pages. References to functions or structures of the form
<i>pcre[16|32]_xxx</i> should be read as meaning
"<i>pcre_xxx</i> when using the 8-bit library,
<i>pcre16_xxx</i> when using the 16-bit library, or
<i>pcre32_xxx</i> when using the 32-bit library".</p>
<p style="margin-left:9%; margin-top: 1em">The current
implementation of PCRE corresponds approximately with Perl
5.12, including support for UTF-8/16/32 encoded strings and
Unicode general category properties. However, UTF-8/16/32
and Unicode support has to be explicitly enabled; it is not
the default. The Unicode tables correspond to Unicode
release 6.3.0.</p>
<p style="margin-left:9%; margin-top: 1em">In addition to
the Perl-compatible matching function, PCRE contains an
alternative function that matches the same compiled patterns
in a different way. In certain circumstances, the
alternative function has some advantages. For a discussion
of the two matching algorithms, see the <b>pcrematching</b>
page.</p>
<p style="margin-left:9%; margin-top: 1em">PCRE is written
in C and released as a C library. A number of people have
written wrappers and interfaces of various kinds. In
particular, Google Inc. have provided a comprehensive C++
wrapper for the 8-bit library. This is now included as part
of the PCRE distribution. The <b>pcrecpp</b> page has
details of this interface. Other people’s
contributions can be found in the <i>Contrib</i> directory
at the primary FTP site, which is:</p>
<p style="margin-left:9%; margin-top: 1em">ftp://ftp.csx.cam.ac.uk/pub/software/programming/pcre</p>
<p style="margin-left:9%; margin-top: 1em">Details of
exactly which Perl regular expression features are and are
not supported by PCRE are given in separate documents. See
the <b>pcrepattern</b> and <b>pcrecompat</b> pages. There is
a syntax summary in the <b>pcresyntax</b> page.</p>
<p style="margin-left:9%; margin-top: 1em">Some features of
PCRE can be included, excluded, or changed when the library
is built. The <b>pcre_config()</b> function makes it
possible for a client to discover which features are
available. The features themselves are described in the
<b>pcrebuild</b> page. Documentation about building PCRE for
various operating systems can be found in the <b>README</b>
and <b>NON-AUTOTOOLS_BUILD</b> files in the source
distribution.</p>
<p style="margin-left:9%; margin-top: 1em">The libraries
contains a number of undocumented internal functions and
data tables that are used by more than one of the exported
external functions, but which are not intended for use by
external callers. Their names all begin with
"_pcre_" or "_pcre16_" or
"_pcre32_", which hopefully will not provoke any
name clashes. In some environments, it is possible to
control which external symbols are exported when a shared
library is built, and in these cases the undocumented
symbols are not exported.</p>
<h2>SECURITY CONSIDERATIONS
<a name="SECURITY CONSIDERATIONS"></a>
</h2>
<p style="margin-left:9%; margin-top: 1em">If you are using
PCRE in a non-UTF application that permits users to supply
arbitrary patterns for compilation, you should be aware of a
feature that allows users to turn on UTF support from within
a pattern, provided that PCRE was built with UTF support.
For example, an 8-bit pattern that begins with
"(*UTF8)" or "(*UTF)" turns on UTF-8
mode, which interprets patterns and subjects as strings of
UTF-8 characters instead of individual 8-bit characters.
This causes both the pattern and any data against which it
is matched to be checked for UTF-8 validity. If the data
string is very long, such a check might use sufficiently
many resources as to cause your application to lose
performance.</p>
<p style="margin-left:9%; margin-top: 1em">One way of
guarding against this possibility is to use the
<b>pcre_fullinfo()</b> function to check the compiled
pattern’s options for UTF. Alternatively, from release
8.33, you can set the PCRE_NEVER_UTF option at compile time.
This causes a compile time error if a pattern contains a
UTF-setting sequence.</p>
<p style="margin-left:9%; margin-top: 1em">If your
application is one that supports UTF, be aware that validity
checking can take time. If the same data string is to be
matched many times, you can use the
PCRE_NO_UTF[8|16|32]_CHECK option for the second and
subsequent matches to save redundant checks.</p>
<p style="margin-left:9%; margin-top: 1em">Another way that
performance can be hit is by running a pattern that has a
very large search tree against a string that will never
match. Nested unlimited repeats in a pattern are a common
example. PCRE provides some protection against this: see the
PCRE_EXTRA_MATCH_LIMIT feature in the <b>pcreapi</b>
page.</p>
<h2>USER DOCUMENTATION
<a name="USER DOCUMENTATION"></a>
</h2>
<p style="margin-left:9%; margin-top: 1em">The user
documentation for PCRE comprises a number of different
sections. In the "man" format, each of these is a
separate "man page". In the HTML format, each is a
separate page, linked from the index page. In the plain text
format, the descriptions of the <b>pcregrep</b> and
<b>pcretest</b> programs are in files called
<b>pcregrep.txt</b> and <b>pcretest.txt</b>, respectively.
The remaining sections, except for the <b>pcredemo</b>
section (which is a program listing), are concatenated in
<b>pcre.txt</b>, for ease of searching. The sections are as
follows:</p>
<p style="margin-left:9%; margin-top: 1em">pcre this
