<h2>NAME
<a name="NAME"></a>
</h2>
<p style="margin-left:9%; margin-top: 1em">PCRE2 -
Perl-compatible regular expressions (revised API)</p>
<h2>PCRE2 PERFORMANCE
<a name="PCRE2 PERFORMANCE"></a>
</h2>
<p style="margin-left:9%; margin-top: 1em">Two aspects of
performance are discussed below: memory usage and processing
time. The way you express your pattern as a regular
expression can affect both of them.</p>
<h2>COMPILED PATTERN MEMORY USAGE
<a name="COMPILED PATTERN MEMORY USAGE"></a>
</h2>
<p style="margin-left:9%; margin-top: 1em">Patterns are
compiled by PCRE2 into a reasonably efficient interpretive
code, so that most simple patterns do not use much memory
for storing the compiled version. However, there is one case
where the memory usage of a compiled pattern can be
unexpectedly large. If a parenthesized group has a
quantifier with a minimum greater than 1 and/or a limited
maximum, the whole group is repeated in the compiled code.
For example, the pattern</p>
<p style="margin-left:9%; margin-top: 1em">(abc|def){2,4}</p>
<p style="margin-left:9%; margin-top: 1em">is compiled as
if it were</p>
<p style="margin-left:9%; margin-top: 1em">(abc|def)(abc|def)((abc|def)(abc|def)?)?</p>
<p style="margin-left:9%; margin-top: 1em">(Technical
aside: It is done this way so that backtrack points within
each of the repetitions can be independently
maintained.)</p>
<p style="margin-left:9%; margin-top: 1em">For regular
expressions whose quantifiers use only small numbers, this
is not usually a problem. However, if the numbers are large,
and particularly if such repetitions are nested, the memory
usage can become an embarrassment. For example, the very
simple pattern</p>
<p style="margin-left:9%; margin-top: 1em">((ab){1,1000}c){1,3}</p>
<p style="margin-left:9%; margin-top: 1em">uses over 50KiB
when compiled using the 8-bit library. When PCRE2 is
compiled with its default internal pointer size of two
bytes, the size limit on a compiled pattern is 65535 code
units in the 8-bit and 16-bit libraries, and this is reached
with the above pattern if the outer repetition is increased
from 3 to 4. PCRE2 can be compiled to use larger internal
pointers and thus handle larger compiled patterns, but it is
better to try to rewrite your pattern to use less memory if
you can.</p>
<p style="margin-left:9%; margin-top: 1em">One way of
reducing the memory usage for such patterns is to make use
of PCRE2’s "subroutine" facility. Re-writing
the above pattern as</p>
<p style="margin-left:9%; margin-top: 1em">((ab)(?2){0,999}c)(?1){0,2}</p>
<p style="margin-left:9%; margin-top: 1em">reduces the
memory requirements to around 16KiB, and indeed it remains
under 20KiB even with the outer repetition increased to 100.
However, this kind of pattern is not always exactly
equivalent, because any captures within subroutine calls are
lost when the subroutine completes. If this is not a
problem, this kind of rewriting will allow you to process
patterns that PCRE2 cannot otherwise handle. The matching
performance of the two different versions of the pattern are
roughly the same. (This applies from release 10.30 - things
were different in earlier releases.)</p>
<h2>STACK AND HEAP USAGE AT RUN TIME
<a name="STACK AND HEAP USAGE AT RUN TIME"></a>
</h2>
<p style="margin-left:9%; margin-top: 1em">From release
10.30, the interpretive (non-JIT) version of
<b>pcre2_match()</b> uses very little system stack at run
time. In earlier releases recursive function calls could use
a great deal of stack, and this could cause problems, but
this usage has been eliminated. Backtracking positions are
now explicitly remembered in memory frames controlled by the
code.</p>
<p style="margin-left:9%; margin-top: 1em">The size of each
frame depends on the size of pointer variables and the
number of capturing parenthesized groups in the pattern
being matched. On a 64-bit system the frame size for a
pattern with no captures is 128 bytes. For each capturing
group the size increases by 16 bytes.</p>
<p style="margin-left:9%; margin-top: 1em">Until release
10.41, an initial 20KiB frames vector was allocated on the
system stack, but this still caused some issues for
multi-thread applications where each thread has a very small
stack. From release 10.41 backtracking memory frames are
always held in heap memory. An initial heap allocation is
obtained the first time any match data block is passed to
<b>pcre2_match()</b>. This is remembered with the match data
block and re-used if that block is used for another match.
It is freed when the match data block itself is freed.</p>
<p style="margin-left:9%; margin-top: 1em">The size of the
initial block is the larger of 20KiB or ten times the
pattern’s frame size, unless the heap limit is less
than this, in which case the heap limit is used. If the
initial block proves to be too small during matching, it is
replaced by a larger block, subject to the heap limit. The
heap limit is checked only when a new block is to be
allocated. Reducing the heap limit between calls to
<b>pcre2_match()</b> with the same match data block does not
affect the saved block.</p>
<p style="margin-left:9%; margin-top: 1em">In contrast to
<b>pcre2_match()</b>, <b>pcre2_dfa_match()</b> does use
recursive function calls, but only for processing atomic
groups, lookaround assertions, and recursion within the
pattern. The original version of the code used to allocate
quite large internal workspace vectors on the stack, which
caused some problems for some patterns in environments with
small stacks. From release 10.32 the code for
<b>pcre2_dfa_match()</b> has been re-factored to use heap
memory when necessary for internal workspace when recursing,
though recursive function calls are still used.</p>
<p style="margin-left:9%; margin-top: 1em">The "match
depth" parameter can be used to limit the depth of
function recursion, and the "match heap" parameter
to limit heap memory in <b>pcre2_dfa_match()</b>.</p>
<h2>PROCESSING TIME
<a name="PROCESSING TIME"></a>
</h2>
<p style="margin-left:9%; margin-top: 1em">Certain items in
regular expression patterns are processed more efficiently
than others. It is more efficient to use a character class
like [aeiou] than a set of single-character alternatives
such as (a|e|i|o|u). In general, the simplest construction
that provides the required behaviour is usually the most
efficient. Jeffrey Friedl’s book contains a lot of
useful general discussion about optimizing regular
expressions for efficient performance. This document
contains a few observations about PCRE2.</p>
<p style="margin-left:9%; margin-top: 1em">Using Unicode
character properties (the \p, \P, and \X escapes) is slow,
because PCRE2 has to use a multi-stage table lookup whenever
it needs a character’s property. If you can find an
alternative pattern that does not use character properties,
it will probably be faster.</p>
<p style="margin-left:9%; margin-top: 1em">By default, the
escape sequences \b, \d, \s, and \w, and the POSIX character
classes such as [:alpha:] do not use Unicode properties,
partly for backwards compatibility, and partly for
performance reasons. However, you can set the PCRE2_UCP
option or start the pattern with (*UCP) if you want Unicode
character properties to be used. This can double the
matching time for items such as \d, when matched with
<b>pcre2_match()</b>; the performance loss is less with a
DFA matching function, and in both cases there is not much
difference for \b.</p>
<p style="margin-left:9%; margin-top: 1em">When a pattern
begins with .* not in atomic parentheses, nor in parentheses
that are the subject of a backreference, and the
PCRE2_DOTALL option is set, the pattern is implicitly
anchored by PCRE2, since it can match only at the start of a
subject string. If the pattern has multiple top-level
branches, they must all be anchorable. The optimization can
be disabled by the PCRE2_NO_DOTSTAR_ANCHOR option, and is
automatically disabled if the pattern contains (*PRUNE) or
(*SKIP).</p>
<p style="margin-left:9%; margin-top: 1em">If PCRE2_DOTALL
is not set, PCRE2 cannot make this optimization, because the
dot metacharacter does not then match a newline, and if the
subject string contains newlines, the pattern may match from
the character immediately following one of them instead of
from the very start. For example, the pattern</p>
<p style="margin-left:9%; margin-top: 1em">.*second</p>
<p style="margin-left:9%; margin-top: 1em">matches the
subject "first\nand second" (where \n stands for a
newline character), with the match starting at the seventh
character. In order to do this, PCRE2 has to retry the match
starting after every newline in the subject.</p>
<p style="margin-left:9%; margin-top: 1em">If you are using
such a pattern with subject strings that do not contain
newlines, the best performance is obtained by setting
PCRE2_DOTALL, or starting the pattern with ˆ.* or
ˆ.*? to indicate explicit anchoring. That saves PCRE2
from having to scan along the subject looking for a newline
to restart at.</p>
<p style="margin-left:9%; margin-top: 1em">Beware of
patterns that contain nested indefinite repeats. These can
take a long time to run when applied to a string that does
not match. Consider the pattern fragment</p>
<p style="margin-left:9%; margin-top: 1em">ˆ(a+)*</p>
<p style="margin-left:9%; margin-top: 1em">This can match
"aaaa" in 16 different ways, and this number
increases very rapidly as the string gets longer. (The *
repeat can match 0, 1, 2, 3, or 4 times, and for each of
those cases other than 0 or 4, the + repeats can match
different numbers of times.) When the remainder of the
pattern is such that the entire match is going to fail,
PCRE2 has in principle to try every possible variation, and
this can take an extremely long time, even for relatively
short strings.</p>
<p style="margin-left:9%; margin-top: 1em">An optimization
catches some of the more simple cases such as</p>
<p style="margin-left:9%; margin-top: 1em">(a+)*b</p>
<p style="margin-left:9%; margin-top: 1em">where a literal
character follows. Before embarking on the standard matching
procedure, PCRE2 checks that there is a "b" later
in the subject string, and if there is not, it fails the
match immediately. However, when there is no following
literal this optimization cannot be used. You can see the
difference by comparing the behaviour of</p>
<p style="margin-left:9%; margin-top: 1em">(a+)*\d</p>
<p style="margin-left:9%; margin-top: 1em">with the pattern
above. The former gives a failure almost instantly when
applied to a whole line of "a" characters, whereas
the latter takes an appreciable time with strings longer
than about 20 characters.</p>
<p style="margin-left:9%; margin-top: 1em">In many cases,
the solution to this kind of performance issue is to use an
atomic group or a possessive quantifier. This can often
reduce memory requirements as well. As another example,
consider this pattern:</p>
<p style="margin-left:9%; margin-top: 1em">([ˆ&lt;]|&lt;(?!inet))+</p>
<p style="margin-left:9%; margin-top: 1em">It matches from
wherever it starts until it encounters "&lt;inet"
or the end of the data, and is the kind of pattern that
might be used when processing an XML file. Each iteration of
the outer parentheses matches either one character that is
not "&lt;" or a "&lt;" that is not
followed by "inet". However, each time a
parenthesis is processed, a backtracking position is passed,
so this formulation uses a memory frame for each matched
character. For a long string, a lot of memory is required.
Consider now this rewritten pattern, which matches exactly
the same strings:</p>
<p style="margin-left:9%; margin-top: 1em">([ˆ&lt;]++|&lt;(?!inet))+</p>
<p style="margin-left:9%; margin-top: 1em">This runs much
faster, because sequences of characters that do not contain
"&lt;" are "swallowed" in one item
inside the parentheses, and a possessive quantifier is used
to stop any backtracking into the runs of
non-"&lt;" characters. This version also uses a
lot less memory because entry to a new set of parentheses
happens only when a "&lt;" character that is not
followed by "inet" is encountered (and we assume
this is relatively rare).</p>
<p style="margin-left:9%; margin-top: 1em">This example
shows that one way of optimizing performance when matching
long subject strings is to write repeated parenthesized
subpatterns to match more than one character whenever
possible.</p>
<h3>SETTING RESOURCE LIMITS
<a name="SETTING RESOURCE LIMITS"></a>
</h3>
<p style="margin-left:9%; margin-top: 1em">You can set
limits on the amount of processing that takes place when
matching, and on the amount of heap memory that is used. The
default values of the limits are very large, and unlikely
ever to operate. They can be changed when PCRE2 is built,
and they can also be set when <b>pcre2_match()</b> or
<b>pcre2_dfa_match()</b> is called. For details of these
interfaces, see the <b>pcre2build</b> documentation and the
section entitled "The match context" in the
<b>pcre2api</b> documentation.</p>
<p style="margin-left:9%; margin-top: 1em">The
<b>pcre2test</b> test program has a modifier called
"find_limits" which, if applied to a subject line,
causes it to find the smallest limits that allow a pattern
to match. This is done by repeatedly matching with different
limits.</p>
