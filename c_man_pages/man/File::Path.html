<h2>DESCRIPTION
<a name="DESCRIPTION"></a>
</h2>
<p style="margin-left:9%; margin-top: 1em">This module
provides a convenient way to create directories of arbitrary
depth and to delete an entire directory subtree from the
filesystem.</p>
<p style="margin-left:9%; margin-top: 1em">The following
functions are provided: <br/>
make_path( $dir1, $dir2, .... ) <br/>
make_path( $dir1, $dir2, ...., \%opts )</p>
<p style="margin-left:14%;">The "make_path"
function creates the given directories if they don't exist
before, much like the Unix command "mkdir
−p".</p>
<p style="margin-left:14%; margin-top: 1em">The function
accepts a list of directories to be created. Its behaviour
may be tuned by an optional hashref appearing as the last
parameter on the call.</p>
<p style="margin-left:14%; margin-top: 1em">The function
returns the list of directories actually created during the
call; in scalar context the number of directories
created.</p>
<p style="margin-left:14%; margin-top: 1em">The following
keys are recognised in the option hash: <br/>
mode =&gt; $num</p>
<p style="margin-left:19%;">The numeric permissions mode to
apply to each created directory (defaults to 0777), to be
modified by the current "umask". If the directory
already exists (and thus does not need to be created), the
permissions will not be modified.</p>
<p style="margin-left:19%; margin-top: 1em">"mask"
is recognised as an alias for this parameter.</p>
<p style="margin-left:14%;">chmod =&gt; $num</p>
<p style="margin-left:19%;">Takes a numeric mode to apply
to each created directory (not modified by the current
"umask"). If the directory already exists (and
thus does not need to be created), the permissions will not
be modified.</p>
<p style="margin-left:14%;">verbose =&gt; $bool</p>
<p style="margin-left:19%;">If present, will cause
"make_path" to print the name of each directory as
it is created. By default nothing is printed.</p>
<p style="margin-left:14%;">error =&gt; \$err</p>
<p style="margin-left:19%;">If present, it should be a
reference to a scalar. This scalar will be made to reference
an array, which will be used to store any errors that are
encountered. See the "ERROR HANDLING" section for
more information.</p>
<p style="margin-left:19%; margin-top: 1em">If this
parameter is not used, certain error conditions may raise a
fatal error that will cause the program to halt, unless
trapped in an "eval" block.</p>
<p style="margin-left:14%;">owner =&gt; $owner <br/>
user =&gt; $owner <br/>
uid =&gt; $owner</p>
<p style="margin-left:19%;">If present, will cause any
created directory to be owned by $owner. If the value is
numeric, it will be interpreted as a uid; otherwise a
username is assumed. An error will be issued if the username
cannot be mapped to a uid, the uid does not exist or the
process lacks the privileges to change ownership.</p>
<p style="margin-left:19%; margin-top: 1em">Ownership of
directories that already exist will not be changed.</p>
<p style="margin-left:19%; margin-top: 1em">"user"
and "uid" are aliases of "owner".</p>
<p style="margin-left:14%;">group =&gt; $group</p>
<p style="margin-left:19%;">If present, will cause any
created directory to be owned by the group $group. If the
value is numeric, it will be interpreted as a gid; otherwise
a group name is assumed. An error will be issued if the
group name cannot be mapped to a gid, the gid does not exist
or the process lacks the privileges to change group
ownership.</p>
<p style="margin-left:19%; margin-top: 1em">Group ownership
of directories that already exist will not be changed.</p>
<p style="margin-left:19%; margin-top: 1em">make_path
'/var/tmp/webcache', {owner=&gt;'nobody',
group=&gt;'nogroup'};</p>
<p style="margin-left:9%;">mkpath( $dir ) <br/>
mkpath( $dir, $verbose, $mode ) <br/>
mkpath( [$dir1, $dir2,...], $verbose, $mode ) <br/>
mkpath( $dir1, $dir2,..., \%opt )</p>
<p style="margin-left:14%;">The mkpath() function provide
the legacy interface of make_path() with a different
interpretation of the arguments passed. The behaviour and
return value of the function is otherwise identical to
make_path().</p>
<p style="margin-left:9%;">remove_tree( $dir1, $dir2, ....
) <br/>
remove_tree( $dir1, $dir2, ...., \%opts )</p>
<p style="margin-left:14%;">The "remove_tree"
function deletes the given directories and any files and
subdirectories they might contain, much like the Unix
command "rm −rf" or the Windows commands
"rmdir /s" and "rd /s".</p>
<p style="margin-left:14%; margin-top: 1em">The function
accepts a list of directories to be removed. (In point of
fact, it will also accept filesystem entries which are not
directories, such as regular files and symlinks. But, as its
name suggests, its intent is to remove trees rather than
individual files.)</p>
<p style="margin-left:14%; margin-top: 1em">remove_tree()'s
behaviour may be tuned by an optional hashref appearing as
the last parameter on the call. If an empty string is passed
to "remove_tree", an error will occur.</p>
<p style="margin-left:14%; margin-top: 1em"><b>NOTE:</b>
For security reasons, we strongly advise use of the
hashref−as−final−argument syntax
−− specifically, with a setting of the
"safe" element to a true value.</p>
<p style="margin-left:14%; margin-top: 1em">remove_tree(
$dir1, $dir2, ...., <br/>
{ <br/>
safe =&gt; 1, <br/>
... # other key−value pairs <br/>
}, <br/>
);</p>
<p style="margin-left:14%; margin-top: 1em">The function
returns the number of files successfully deleted.</p>
<p style="margin-left:14%; margin-top: 1em">The following
keys are recognised in the option hash: <br/>
verbose =&gt; $bool</p>
<p style="margin-left:19%;">If present, will cause
"remove_tree" to print the name of each file as it
is unlinked. By default nothing is printed.</p>
<p style="margin-left:14%;">safe =&gt; $bool</p>
<p style="margin-left:19%;">When set to a true value, will
cause "remove_tree" to skip the files for which
the process lacks the required privileges needed to delete
files, such as delete privileges on VMS. In other words, the
code will make no attempt to alter file permissions. Thus,
if the process is interrupted, no filesystem object will be
left in a more permissive mode.</p>
<p style="margin-left:14%;">keep_root =&gt; $bool</p>
<p style="margin-left:19%;">When set to a true value, will
cause all files and subdirectories to be removed, except the
initially specified directories. This comes in handy when
cleaning out an application's scratch directory.</p>
<p style="margin-left:19%; margin-top: 1em">remove_tree(
'/tmp', {keep_root =&gt; 1} );</p>
<p style="margin-left:14%;">result =&gt; \$res</p>
<p style="margin-left:19%;">If present, it should be a
reference to a scalar. This scalar will be made to reference
an array, which will be used to store all files and
directories unlinked during the call. If nothing is
unlinked, the array will be empty.</p>
<p style="margin-left:19%; margin-top: 1em">remove_tree(
'/tmp', {result =&gt; \my $list} ); <br/>
print "unlinked $_\n" for @$list;</p>
<p style="margin-left:19%; margin-top: 1em">This is a
useful alternative to the "verbose" key.</p>
<p style="margin-left:14%;">error =&gt; \$err</p>
<p style="margin-left:19%;">If present, it should be a
reference to a scalar. This scalar will be made to reference
an array, which will be used to store any errors that are
encountered. See the "ERROR HANDLING" section for
more information.</p>
<p style="margin-left:19%; margin-top: 1em">Removing things
is a much more dangerous proposition than creating things.
As such, there are certain conditions that
"remove_tree" may encounter that are so dangerous
that the only sane action left is to kill the program.</p>
<p style="margin-left:19%; margin-top: 1em">Use
"error" to trap all that is reasonable (problems
with permissions and the like), and let it die if things get
out of hand. This is the safest course of action.</p>
<p style="margin-left:9%;">rmtree( $dir ) <br/>
rmtree( $dir, $verbose, $safe ) <br/>
rmtree( [$dir1, $dir2,...], $verbose, $safe ) <br/>
rmtree( $dir1, $dir2,..., \%opt )</p>
<p style="margin-left:14%;">The rmtree() function provide
the legacy interface of remove_tree() with a different
interpretation of the arguments passed. The behaviour and
return value of the function is otherwise identical to
remove_tree().</p>
<p style="margin-left:14%; margin-top: 1em"><b>NOTE:</b>
For security reasons, we strongly advise use of the
hashref−as−final−argument syntax,
specifically with a setting of the "safe" element
to a true value.</p>
<p style="margin-left:14%; margin-top: 1em">rmtree( $dir1,

... # other key−value pairs <br/>
}, <br/>
);</p>
<h3>ERROR HANDLING
<a name="ERROR HANDLING"></a>
</h3>
<p style="margin-left:9%; margin-top: 1em"><b>NOTE:</b></p>
<p style="margin-left:14%;">The following error handling
mechanism is consistent throughout all code paths EXCEPT in
cases where the ROOT node is nonexistent. In version 2.11
the maintainers attempted to rectify this inconsistency but
too many downstream modules encountered problems. In such
case, if you require root node evaluation or error checking
prior to calling "make_path" or
"remove_tree", you should take additional
precautions.</p>
<p style="margin-left:9%; margin-top: 1em">If
"make_path" or "remove_tree" encounters
an error, a diagnostic message will be printed to
"STDERR" via "carp" (for non−fatal
errors) or via "croak" (for fatal errors).</p>
<p style="margin-left:9%; margin-top: 1em">If this
behaviour is not desirable, the "error" attribute
may be used to hold a reference to a variable, which will be
used to store the diagnostics. The variable is made a
reference to an array of hash references. Each hash contain
a single key/value pair where the key is the name of the
file, and the value is the error message (including the
contents of $! when appropriate). If a general error is
encountered the diagnostic key will be empty.</p>
<p style="margin-left:9%; margin-top: 1em">An example usage
looks like:</p>
<p style="margin-left:9%; margin-top: 1em">remove_tree(
'foo/bar', 'bar/rat', {error =&gt; \my $err} ); <br/>
if ($err &amp;&amp; @$err) { <br/>
for my $diag (@$err) { <br/>
my ($file, $message) = %$diag; <br/>
if ($file eq '') { <br/>
print "general error: $message\n"; <br/>
} <br/>
else { <br/>
print "problem unlinking $file: $message\n"; <br/>
} <br/>
} <br/>
} <br/>
else { <br/>
print "No error encountered\n"; <br/>
}</p>
<p style="margin-left:9%; margin-top: 1em">Note that if no
errors are encountered, $err will reference an empty array.
This means that $err will always end up TRUE; so you need to
test @$err to determine if errors occurred.</p>
<h3>NOTES
<a name="NOTES"></a>
</h3>
<p style="margin-left:9%; margin-top: 1em">"File::Path"
blindly exports "mkpath" and "rmtree"
into the current namespace. These days, this is considered
bad style, but to change it now would break too much code.
Nonetheless, you are invited to specify what it is you are
expecting to use:</p>
<p style="margin-left:9%; margin-top: 1em">use File::Path
'rmtree';</p>
<p style="margin-left:9%; margin-top: 1em">The routines
"make_path" and "remove_tree" are
<b>not</b> exported by default. You must specify which ones
you want to use.</p>
<p style="margin-left:9%; margin-top: 1em">use File::Path
'remove_tree';</p>
<p style="margin-left:9%; margin-top: 1em">Note that a
side−effect of the above is that "mkpath"
and "rmtree" are no longer exported at all. This
is due to the way the "Exporter" module works. If
you are migrating a codebase to use the new interface, you
will have to list everything explicitly. But that's just
good practice anyway.</p>
<p style="margin-left:9%; margin-top: 1em">use File::Path
qw(remove_tree rmtree);</p>
<p style="margin-left:9%; margin-top: 1em"><i>API
CHANGES</i></p>
<p style="margin-left:9%; margin-top: 1em">The API was
changed in the 2.0 branch. For a time, "mkpath"
and "rmtree" tried, unsuccessfully, to deal with
the two different calling mechanisms. This approach was
considered a failure.</p>
<p style="margin-left:9%; margin-top: 1em">The new
semantics are now only available with "make_path"
and "remove_tree". The old semantics are only
available through "mkpath" and "rmtree".
Users are strongly encouraged to upgrade to at least 2.08 in
order to avoid surprises.</p>
<p style="margin-left:9%; margin-top: 1em"><i>SECURITY
CONSIDERATIONS</i></p>
<p style="margin-left:9%; margin-top: 1em">There were race
conditions in the 1.x implementations of File::Path's
"rmtree" function (although sometimes patched
depending on the OS distribution or platform). The 2.0
version contains code to avoid the problem mentioned in
CVE−2002−0435.</p>
<p style="margin-left:9%; margin-top: 1em">See the
following pages for more information:</p>
<p style="margin-left:9%; margin-top: 1em">http://bugs.debian.org/cgi−bin/bugreport.cgi?bug=286905

<br/>
http://www.debian.org/security/2005/dsa−696</p>
<p style="margin-left:9%; margin-top: 1em">Additionally,
unless the "safe" parameter is set (or the third
parameter in the traditional interface is TRUE), should a
"remove_tree" be interrupted, files that were
originally in read−only mode may now have their
permissions set to a read−write (or "delete
OK") mode.</p>

<p style="margin-left:9%; margin-top: 1em">In February 2017
the cPanel Security Team reported an additional
vulnerability in File−Path. The chmod() logic to make
directories traversable can be abused to set the mode on an
attacker−chosen file to an attacker−chosen
value. This is due to the
time−of−check−to−time−of−use
(TOCTTOU) race condition
(&lt;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Time_of_check_to_time_of_use&gt;)
between the stat() that decides the inode is a directory and
the chmod() that tries to make it user−rwx. CPAN
versions 2.13 and later incorporate a patch provided by John
Lightsey to address this problem. This vulnerability has
been reported as CVE−2017−6512.</p>
<h2>DIAGNOSTICS
<a name="DIAGNOSTICS"></a>
</h2>
<p style="margin-left:9%; margin-top: 1em">FATAL errors
will cause the program to halt ("croak"), since
the problem is so severe that it would be dangerous to
continue. (This can always be trapped with "eval",
but it's not a good idea. Under the circumstances, dying is
the best thing to do).</p>
<p style="margin-left:9%; margin-top: 1em">SEVERE errors
may be trapped using the modern interface. If the they are
not trapped, or if the old interface is used, such an error
will cause the program will halt.</p>
<p style="margin-left:9%; margin-top: 1em">All other errors
may be trapped using the modern interface, otherwise they
will be "carp"ed about. Program execution will not
be halted. <br/>
mkdir [path]: [errmsg] (SEVERE)</p>
<p style="margin-left:14%;">"make_path" was
unable to create the path. Probably some sort of permissions

<h2>BUGS AND LIMITATIONS
<a name="BUGS AND LIMITATIONS"></a>
</h2>
<p style="margin-left:9%; margin-top: 1em">The following
describes <i>File::Path</i> limitations and how to report
bugs.</p>
<h3>MULTITHREADED APPLICATIONS
<a name="MULTITHREADED APPLICATIONS"></a>
</h3>
<p style="margin-left:9%; margin-top: 1em"><i>File::Path</i>
"rmtree" and "remove_tree" will not work
with multithreaded applications due to its use of
"chdir". At this time, no warning or error is
generated in this situation. You will certainly encounter
unexpected results.</p>
<p style="margin-left:9%; margin-top: 1em">The
implementation that surfaces this limitation will not be
changed. See the <i>File::Path::Tiny</i> module for
functionality similar to <i>File::Path</i> but which does
not "chdir".</p>
<h3>NFS Mount Points
<a name="NFS Mount Points"></a>
</h3>
<p style="margin-left:9%; margin-top: 1em"><i>File::Path</i>
is not responsible for triggering the automounts, mirror
mounts, and the contents of network mounted filesystems. If
your NFS implementation requires an action to be performed
on the filesystem in order for <i>File::Path</i> to perform
operations, it is strongly suggested you assure filesystem
availability by reading the root of the mounted
filesystem.</p>
<h3>REPORTING BUGS
<a name="REPORTING BUGS"></a>
</h3>
<p style="margin-left:9%; margin-top: 1em">Please report
all bugs on the RT queue, either via the web interface:</p>
<p style="margin-left:9%; margin-top: 1em">&lt;http://rt.cpan.org/NoAuth/Bugs.html?Dist=File−Path&gt;</p>
<p style="margin-left:9%; margin-top: 1em">or by email:</p>
<p style="margin-left:9%; margin-top: 1em">bug−File−Path@rt.cpan.org</p>
<p style="margin-left:9%; margin-top: 1em">In either case,
please <b>attach</b> patches to the bug report rather than
including them inline in the web post or the body of the
email.</p>
<p style="margin-left:9%; margin-top: 1em">You can also
send pull requests to the Github repository:</p>

<h2>ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS
<a name="ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS"></a>
</h2>
<p style="margin-left:9%; margin-top: 1em">Paul Szabo
identified the race condition originally, and Brendan O'Dea
wrote an implementation for Debian that addressed the
problem. That code was used as a basis for the current code.
Their efforts are greatly appreciated.</p>
<p style="margin-left:9%; margin-top: 1em">Gisle Aas made a
number of improvements to the documentation for 2.07 and his
advice and assistance is also greatly appreciated.</p>
