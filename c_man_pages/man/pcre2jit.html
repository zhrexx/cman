<h2>PCRE2 JUST-IN-TIME COMPILER SUPPORT
<a name="PCRE2 JUST-IN-TIME COMPILER SUPPORT"></a>
</h2>
<p style="margin-left:9%; margin-top: 1em">Just-in-time
compiling is a heavyweight optimization that can greatly
speed up pattern matching. However, it comes at the cost of
extra processing before the match is performed, so it is of
most benefit when the same pattern is going to be matched
many times. This does not necessarily mean many calls of a
matching function; if the pattern is not anchored, matching
attempts may take place many times at various positions in
the subject, even for a single call. Therefore, if the
subject string is very long, it may still pay to use JIT
even for one-off matches. JIT support is available for all
of the 8-bit, 16-bit and 32-bit PCRE2 libraries.</p>
<p style="margin-left:9%; margin-top: 1em">JIT support
applies only to the traditional Perl-compatible matching
function. It does not apply when the DFA matching function
is being used. The code for JIT support was written by
Zoltan Herczeg.</p>
<h2>AVAILABILITY OF JIT SUPPORT
<a name="AVAILABILITY OF JIT SUPPORT"></a>
</h2>
<p style="margin-left:9%; margin-top: 1em">JIT support is
an optional feature of PCRE2. The "configure"
option --enable-jit (or equivalent CMake option) must be set
when PCRE2 is built if you want to use JIT. The support is
limited to the following hardware platforms:</p>
<p style="margin-left:9%; margin-top: 1em">ARM 32-bit (v7,
and Thumb2) <br/>
ARM 64-bit <br/>
IBM s390x 64 bit <br/>
Intel x86 32-bit and 64-bit <br/>
LoongArch 64 bit <br/>
MIPS 32-bit and 64-bit <br/>
Power PC 32-bit and 64-bit <br/>
RISC-V 32-bit and 64-bit</p>
<p style="margin-left:9%; margin-top: 1em">If --enable-jit
is set on an unsupported platform, compilation fails.</p>
<p style="margin-left:9%; margin-top: 1em">A client program
can tell if JIT support is available by calling
<b>pcre2_config()</b> with the PCRE2_CONFIG_JIT option. The
result is one if PCRE2 was built with JIT support, and zero
otherwise. However, having the JIT code available does not
guarantee that it will be used for any particular match. One
reason for this is that there are a number of options and
pattern items that are not supported by JIT (see below).
Another reason is that in some environments JIT is unable to
get memory in which to build its compiled code. The only
guarantee from <b>pcre2_config()</b> is that if it returns
zero, JIT will definitely <i>not</i> be used.</p>
<p style="margin-left:9%; margin-top: 1em">A simple program
does not need to check availability in order to use JIT when
possible. The API is implemented in a way that falls back to
the interpretive code if JIT is not available or cannot be
used for a given match. For programs that need the best
possible performance, there is a "fast path" API
that is JIT-specific.</p>
<h2>SIMPLE USE OF JIT
<a name="SIMPLE USE OF JIT"></a>
</h2>
<p style="margin-left:9%; margin-top: 1em">To make use of
the JIT support in the simplest way, all you have to do is
to call <b>pcre2_jit_compile()</b> after successfully
compiling a pattern with <b>pcre2_compile()</b>. This
function has two arguments: the first is the compiled
pattern pointer that was returned by <b>pcre2_compile()</b>,
and the second is zero or more of the following option bits:
PCRE2_JIT_COMPLETE, PCRE2_JIT_PARTIAL_HARD, or
PCRE2_JIT_PARTIAL_SOFT.</p>
<p style="margin-left:9%; margin-top: 1em">If JIT support
is not available, a call to <b>pcre2_jit_compile()</b> does
nothing and returns PCRE2_ERROR_JIT_BADOPTION. Otherwise,
the compiled pattern is passed to the JIT compiler, which
turns it into machine code that executes much faster than
the normal interpretive code, but yields exactly the same
results. The returned value from <b>pcre2_jit_compile()</b>
is zero on success, or a negative error code.</p>
<p style="margin-left:9%; margin-top: 1em">There is a limit
to the size of pattern that JIT supports, imposed by the
size of machine stack that it uses. The exact rules are not
documented because they may change at any time, in
particular, when new optimizations are introduced. If a
pattern is too big, a call to <b>pcre2_jit_compile()</b>
returns PCRE2_ERROR_NOMEMORY.</p>
<p style="margin-left:9%; margin-top: 1em">PCRE2_JIT_COMPLETE
requests the JIT compiler to generate code for complete
matches. If you want to run partial matches using the
PCRE2_PARTIAL_HARD or PCRE2_PARTIAL_SOFT options of
<b>pcre2_match()</b>, you should set one or both of the
other options as well as, or instead of PCRE2_JIT_COMPLETE.
The JIT compiler generates different optimized code for each
of the three modes (normal, soft partial, hard partial).
When <b>pcre2_match()</b> is called, the appropriate code is
run if it is available. Otherwise, the pattern is matched
using interpretive code.</p>
<p style="margin-left:9%; margin-top: 1em">You can call
<b>pcre2_jit_compile()</b> multiple times for the same
compiled pattern. It does nothing if it has previously
compiled code for any of the option bits. For example, you
can call it once with PCRE2_JIT_COMPLETE and (perhaps later,
when you find you need partial matching) again with
PCRE2_JIT_COMPLETE and PCRE2_JIT_PARTIAL_HARD. This time it
will ignore PCRE2_JIT_COMPLETE and just compile code for
partial matching. If <b>pcre2_jit_compile()</b> is called
with no option bits set, it immediately returns zero. This
is an alternative way of testing whether JIT is
available.</p>
<p style="margin-left:9%; margin-top: 1em">At present, it
is not possible to free JIT compiled code except when the
entire compiled pattern is freed by calling
<b>pcre2_code_free()</b>.</p>
<p style="margin-left:9%; margin-top: 1em">In some
circumstances you may need to call additional functions.
These are described in the section entitled
"Controlling the JIT stack" below.</p>
<p style="margin-left:9%; margin-top: 1em">There are some
<b>pcre2_match()</b> options that are not supported by JIT,
and there are also some pattern items that JIT cannot
handle. Details are given below. In both cases, matching
automatically falls back to the interpretive code. If you
want to know whether JIT was actually used for a particular
match, you should arrange for a JIT callback function to be
set up as described in the section entitled
"Controlling the JIT stack" below, even if you do
not need to supply a non-default JIT stack. Such a callback
function is called whenever JIT code is about to be obeyed.
If the match-time options are not right for JIT execution,
the callback function is not obeyed.</p>
<p style="margin-left:9%; margin-top: 1em">If the JIT
compiler finds an unsupported item, no JIT data is
generated. You can find out if JIT compilation was
successful for a compiled pattern by calling
<b>pcre2_pattern_info()</b> with the PCRE2_INFO_JITSIZE
option. A non-zero result means that JIT compilation was
successful. A result of 0 means that JIT support is not
available, or the pattern was not processed by
<b>pcre2_jit_compile()</b>, or the JIT compiler was not able
to handle the pattern. Successful JIT compilation does not,
however, guarantee the use of JIT at match time because
there are some match time options that are not supported by
JIT.</p>
<h2>MATCHING SUBJECTS CONTAINING INVALID UTF
<a name="MATCHING SUBJECTS CONTAINING INVALID UTF"></a>
</h2>
<p style="margin-left:9%; margin-top: 1em">When a pattern
is compiled with the PCRE2_UTF option, subject strings are
normally expected to be a valid sequence of UTF code units.
By default, this is checked at the start of matching and an
error is generated if invalid UTF is detected. The
PCRE2_NO_UTF_CHECK option can be passed to
<b>pcre2_match()</b> to skip the check (for improved
performance) if you are sure that a subject string is valid.
If this option is used with an invalid string, the result is
undefined. The calling program may crash or loop or
otherwise misbehave.</p>
<p style="margin-left:9%; margin-top: 1em">However, a way
of running matches on strings that may contain invalid UTF
sequences is available. Calling <b>pcre2_compile()</b> with
the PCRE2_MATCH_INVALID_UTF option has two effects: it tells
the interpreter in <b>pcre2_match()</b> to support invalid
UTF, and, if <b>pcre2_jit_compile()</b> is subsequently
called, the compiled JIT code also supports invalid UTF.
Details of how this support works, in both the JIT and the
interpretive cases, is given in the <b>pcre2unicode</b>
documentation.</p>
<p style="margin-left:9%; margin-top: 1em">There is also an
obsolete option for <b>pcre2_jit_compile()</b> called
PCRE2_JIT_INVALID_UTF, which currently exists only for
backward compatibility. It is superseded by the
<b>pcre2_compile()</b> option PCRE2_MATCH_INVALID_UTF and
should no longer be used. It may be removed in future.</p>
<h2>UNSUPPORTED OPTIONS AND PATTERN ITEMS
<a name="UNSUPPORTED OPTIONS AND PATTERN ITEMS"></a>
</h2>
<p style="margin-left:9%; margin-top: 1em">The
<b>pcre2_match()</b> options that are supported for JIT
matching are PCRE2_COPY_MATCHED_SUBJECT, PCRE2_NOTBOL,
PCRE2_NOTEOL, PCRE2_NOTEMPTY, PCRE2_NOTEMPTY_ATSTART,
PCRE2_NO_UTF_CHECK, PCRE2_PARTIAL_HARD, and
PCRE2_PARTIAL_SOFT. The PCRE2_ANCHORED and PCRE2_ENDANCHORED
options are not supported at match time.</p>
<p style="margin-left:9%; margin-top: 1em">If the
PCRE2_NO_JIT option is passed to <b>pcre2_match()</b> it
disables the use of JIT, forcing matching by the interpreter
code.</p>
<p style="margin-left:9%; margin-top: 1em">The only
unsupported pattern items are \C (match a single data unit)
when running in a UTF mode, and a callout immediately before
an assertion condition in a conditional group.</p>
<h2>RETURN VALUES FROM JIT MATCHING
<a name="RETURN VALUES FROM JIT MATCHING"></a>
</h2>
<p style="margin-left:9%; margin-top: 1em">When a pattern
is matched using JIT, the return values are the same as
those given by the interpretive <b>pcre2_match()</b> code,
with the addition of one new error code:
PCRE2_ERROR_JIT_STACKLIMIT. This means that the memory used
for the JIT stack was insufficient. See "Controlling
the JIT stack" below for a discussion of JIT stack
usage.</p>
<p style="margin-left:9%; margin-top: 1em">The error code
PCRE2_ERROR_MATCHLIMIT is returned by the JIT code if
searching a very large pattern tree goes on for too long, as
it is in the same circumstance when JIT is not used, but the
details of exactly what is counted are not the same. The
PCRE2_ERROR_DEPTHLIMIT error code is never returned when JIT
matching is used.</p>
<h2>CONTROLLING THE JIT STACK
<a name="CONTROLLING THE JIT STACK"></a>
</h2>
<p style="margin-left:9%; margin-top: 1em">When the
compiled JIT code runs, it needs a block of memory to use as
a stack. By default, it uses 32KiB on the machine stack.
However, some large or complicated patterns need more than
this. The error PCRE2_ERROR_JIT_STACKLIMIT is given when
there is not enough stack. Three functions are provided for
managing blocks of memory for use as JIT stacks. There is
further discussion about the use of JIT stacks in the
section entitled "JIT stack FAQ" below.</p>
<p style="margin-left:9%; margin-top: 1em">The
<b>pcre2_jit_stack_create()</b> function creates a JIT
stack. Its arguments are a starting size, a maximum size,
and a general context (for memory allocation functions, or
NULL for standard memory allocation). It returns a pointer
to an opaque structure of type <b>pcre2_jit_stack</b>, or
NULL if there is an error. The <b>pcre2_jit_stack_free()</b>
function is used to free a stack that is no longer needed.
If its argument is NULL, this function returns immediately,
without doing anything. (For the technically minded: the
address space is allocated by mmap or VirtualAlloc.) A
maximum stack size of 512KiB to 1MiB should be more than
enough for any pattern.</p>
<p style="margin-left:9%; margin-top: 1em">The
<b>pcre2_jit_stack_assign()</b> function specifies which
stack JIT code should use. Its arguments are as follows:</p>
<p style="margin-left:9%; margin-top: 1em">pcre2_match_context
*mcontext <br/>
pcre2_jit_callback callback <br/>
void *data</p>
<p style="margin-left:9%; margin-top: 1em">The first
argument is a pointer to a match context. When this is
subsequently passed to a matching function, its information
determines which JIT stack is used. If this argument is
NULL, the function returns immediately, without doing
anything. There are three cases for the values of the other
two options:</p>
<p style="margin-left:9%; margin-top: 1em">(1) If
<i>callback</i> is NULL and <i>data</i> is NULL, an internal
32KiB block <br/>
on the machine stack is used. This is the default when a
match <br/>
context is created.</p>
<p style="margin-left:9%; margin-top: 1em">(2) If
<i>callback</i> is NULL and <i>data</i> is not NULL,
<i>data</i> must be <br/>
a pointer to a valid JIT stack, the result of calling
<b><br/>
pcre2_jit_stack_create()</b>.</p>
<p style="margin-left:9%; margin-top: 1em">(3) If
<i>callback</i> is not NULL, it must point to a function
that is <br/>
called with <i>data</i> as an argument at the start of
matching, in <br/>
order to set up a JIT stack. If the return from the callback
<br/>
function is NULL, the internal 32KiB stack is used;
otherwise the <br/>
return value must be a valid JIT stack, the result of
calling <b><br/>
pcre2_jit_stack_create()</b>.</p>
<p style="margin-left:9%; margin-top: 1em">A callback
function is obeyed whenever JIT code is about to be run; it
is not obeyed when <b>pcre2_match()</b> is called with
options that are incompatible for JIT matching. A callback
function can therefore be used to determine whether a match
operation was executed by JIT or by the interpreter.</p>
<p style="margin-left:9%; margin-top: 1em">You may safely
use the same JIT stack for more than one pattern (either by
assigning directly or by callback), as long as the patterns
are matched sequentially in the same thread. Currently, the
only way to set up non-sequential matches in one thread is
to use callouts: if a callout function starts another match,
that match must use a different JIT stack to the one used
for currently suspended match(es).</p>
<p style="margin-left:9%; margin-top: 1em">In a multithread
application, if you do not specify a JIT stack, or if you
assign or pass back NULL from a callback, that is
thread-safe, because each thread has its own machine stack.
However, if you assign or pass back a non-NULL JIT stack,
this must be a different stack for each thread so that the
application is thread-safe.</p>
<p style="margin-left:9%; margin-top: 1em">Strictly
speaking, even more is allowed. You can assign the same
non-NULL stack to a match context that is used by any number
of patterns, as long as they are not used for matching by
multiple threads at the same time. For example, you could
use the same stack in all compiled patterns, with a global
mutex in the callback to wait until the stack is available
for use. However, this is an inefficient solution, and not
recommended.</p>
<p style="margin-left:9%; margin-top: 1em">This is a
suggestion for how a multithreaded program that needs to set
up non-default JIT stacks might operate:</p>
<p style="margin-left:9%; margin-top: 1em">During thread
initialization <br/>
thread_local_var = pcre2_jit_stack_create(...)</p>
<p style="margin-left:9%; margin-top: 1em">During thread
exit <br/>
pcre2_jit_stack_free(thread_local_var)</p>
<p style="margin-left:9%; margin-top: 1em">Use a one-line
callback function <br/>
return thread_local_var</p>
<p style="margin-left:9%; margin-top: 1em">All the
functions described in this section do nothing if JIT is not
available.</p>
<h2>JIT STACK FAQ
<a name="JIT STACK FAQ"></a>
</h2>
<p style="margin-left:9%; margin-top: 1em">(1) Why do we
need JIT stacks?</p>
<p style="margin-left:9%; margin-top: 1em">PCRE2 (and JIT)
is a recursive, depth-first engine, so it needs a stack
where the local data of the current node is pushed before
checking its child nodes. Allocating real machine stack on
some platforms is difficult. For example, the stack chain
needs to be updated every time if we extend the stack on
PowerPC. Although it is possible, its updating time overhead
decreases performance. So we do the recursion in memory.</p>
<p style="margin-left:9%; margin-top: 1em">(2) Why
don’t we simply allocate blocks of memory with
<b>malloc()</b>?</p>
<p style="margin-left:9%; margin-top: 1em">Modern operating
systems have a nice feature: they can reserve an address
space instead of allocating memory. We can safely allocate
memory pages inside this address space, so the stack could
grow without moving memory data (this is important because
of pointers). Thus we can allocate 1MiB address space, and
use only a single memory page (usually 4KiB) if that is
enough. However, we can still grow up to 1MiB anytime if
needed.</p>
<p style="margin-left:9%; margin-top: 1em">(3) Who
"owns" a JIT stack?</p>
<p style="margin-left:9%; margin-top: 1em">The owner of the
stack is the user program, not the JIT studied pattern or
anything else. The user program must ensure that if a stack
is being used by <b>pcre2_match()</b>, (that is, it is
assigned to a match context that is passed to the pattern
currently running), that stack must not be used by any other
threads (to avoid overwriting the same memory area). The
best practice for multithreaded programs is to allocate a
stack for each thread, and return this stack through the JIT
callback function.</p>
<p style="margin-left:9%; margin-top: 1em">(4) When should
a JIT stack be freed?</p>
<p style="margin-left:9%; margin-top: 1em">You can free a
JIT stack at any time, as long as it will not be used by
<b>pcre2_match()</b> again. When you assign the stack to a
match context, only a pointer is set. There is no reference
counting or any other magic. You can free compiled patterns,
contexts, and stacks in any order, anytime. Just <i>do
not</i> call <b>pcre2_match()</b> with a match context
pointing to an already freed stack, as that will cause
SEGFAULT. (Also, do not free a stack currently used by
<b>pcre2_match()</b> in another thread). You can also
replace the stack in a context at any time when it is not in
use. You should free the previous stack before assigning a
replacement.</p>
<p style="margin-left:9%; margin-top: 1em">(5) Should I
allocate/free a stack every time before/after calling
<b>pcre2_match()</b>?</p>
<p style="margin-left:9%; margin-top: 1em">No, because this
is too costly in terms of resources. However, you could
implement some clever idea which release the stack if it is
not used in let’s say two minutes. The JIT callback
can help to achieve this without keeping a list of
patterns.</p>
<p style="margin-left:9%; margin-top: 1em">(6) OK, the
stack is for long term memory allocation. But what happens
if a pattern causes stack overflow with a stack of 1MiB? Is
that 1MiB kept until the stack is freed?</p>
<p style="margin-left:9%; margin-top: 1em">Especially on
embedded systems, it might be a good idea to release memory
sometimes without freeing the stack. There is no API for
this at the moment. Probably a function call which returns
with the currently allocated memory for any stack and
another which allows releasing memory (shrinking the stack)
would be a good idea if someone needs this.</p>
<p style="margin-left:9%; margin-top: 1em">(7) This is too
much of a headache. Isn’t there any better solution
for JIT stack handling?</p>
<p style="margin-left:9%; margin-top: 1em">No, thanks to
Windows. If POSIX threads were used everywhere, we could
throw out this complicated API.</p>

<p style="margin-left:9%; margin-top: 1em">The JIT
executable allocator does not free all memory when it is
possible. It expects new allocations, and keeps some free
memory around to improve allocation speed. However, in low
memory conditions, it might be better to free all possible
memory. You can cause this to happen by calling
pcre2_jit_free_unused_memory(). Its argument is a general
context, for custom memory management, or NULL for standard
memory management.</p>

<h2>JIT FAST PATH API
<a name="JIT FAST PATH API"></a>
</h2>
<p style="margin-left:9%; margin-top: 1em">Because the API
described above falls back to interpreted matching when JIT
is not available, it is convenient for programs that are
written for general use in many environments. However,
calling JIT via <b>pcre2_match()</b> does have a performance
impact. Programs that are written for use where JIT is known
to be available, and which need the best possible
performance, can instead use a "fast path" API to
call JIT matching directly instead of calling
<b>pcre2_match()</b> (obviously only for patterns that have
been successfully processed by
<b>pcre2_jit_compile()</b>).</p>
<p style="margin-left:9%; margin-top: 1em">The fast path
function is called <b>pcre2_jit_match()</b>, and it takes
exactly the same arguments as <b>pcre2_match()</b>. However,
the subject string must be specified with a length;
PCRE2_ZERO_TERMINATED is not supported. Unsupported option
bits (for example, PCRE2_ANCHORED and PCRE2_ENDANCHORED) are
ignored, as is the PCRE2_NO_JIT option. The return values
are also the same as for <b>pcre2_match()</b>, plus
PCRE2_ERROR_JIT_BADOPTION if a matching mode (partial or
complete) is requested that was not compiled.</p>
<p style="margin-left:9%; margin-top: 1em">When you call
<b>pcre2_match()</b>, as well as testing for invalid
options, a number of other sanity checks are performed on
the arguments. For example, if the subject pointer is NULL
but the length is non-zero, an immediate error is given.
Also, unless PCRE2_NO_UTF_CHECK is set, a UTF subject string
is tested for validity. In the interests of speed, these
checks do not happen on the JIT fast path. If invalid UTF
data is passed when PCRE2_MATCH_INVALID_UTF was not set for
<b>pcre2_compile()</b>, the result is undefined. The program
may crash or loop or give wrong results. In the absence of
PCRE2_MATCH_INVALID_UTF you should call
<b>pcre2_jit_match()</b> in UTF mode only if you are sure
the subject is valid.</p>
<p style="margin-left:9%; margin-top: 1em">Bypassing the
sanity checks and the <b>pcre2_match()</b> wrapping can give
speedups of more than 10%.</p>
