<h2>DESCRIPTION
<a name="DESCRIPTION"></a>
</h2>
<p style="margin-left:9%; margin-top: 1em">The module
<b>Locale::TextDomain</b>(3pm) provides a high−level
interface to Perl message translation.</p>
<h3>Textdomains
<a name="Textdomains"></a>
</h3>
<p style="margin-left:9%; margin-top: 1em">When you request
a translation for a given string, the system used in
libintl−perl follows a standard strategy to find a
suitable message catalog containing the translation: Unless
you explicitely define a name for the message catalog,
libintl−perl will assume that your catalog is called
'messages' (unless you have changed the default value to
something else via <b>Locale::Messages</b>(3pm), method
<b>textdomain()</b>).</p>
<p style="margin-left:9%; margin-top: 1em">You might think
that his default strategy leaves room for optimization and
you are right. It would be a lot smarter if multiple
software packages, all with their individual message
catalogs, could be installed on one system, and it should
also be possible that third−party components of your
software (like Perl modules) can load their message
catalogs, too, without interfering with yours.</p>
<p style="margin-left:9%; margin-top: 1em">The solution is
clear, you have to assign a unique name to your message
database, and you have to specify that name at
run−time. That unique name is the so−called
<i>textdomain</i> of your software package. The name is
actually arbitrary but you should follow these
best−practice guidelines to ensure maximum
interoperability: <br/>
File System Safety</p>
<p style="margin-left:19%;">In practice, textdomains get
mapped into file names, and you should therefore make sure
that the textdomain you choose is a valid filename on every
system that will run your software.</p>
<p style="margin-left:9%;">Case−sensitivity</p>
<p style="margin-left:19%;">Textdomains are always
case−sensitive (i. e. 'Package' and 'PACKAGE' are not
the same). However, since the message catalogs will be
stored on file systems, that may or may not distinguish case
when looking up file names, you should avoid potential
conflicts here.</p>
<p style="margin-left:9%;">Textdomain Should Match CPAN
Name</p>
<p style="margin-left:19%;">If your software is listed as a
module on CPAN, you should simply choose the name on CPAN as
your textdomain. The textdomain for libintl−perl is
hence 'libintl−perl'. But please replace all periods
('.') in your package name with an underscore because
...</p>
<p style="margin-left:9%;">Internet Domain Names as a
Fallback</p>
<p style="margin-left:19%;">... if your software is
<i>not</i> a module listed on CPAN, as a last resort you
should use the Java(tm) package scheme, i. e. choose an
internet domain that you are owner of (or ask the owner of
an internet domain) and concatenate your preferred
textdomain with the reversed internet domain. Example: Your
company runs the web−site 'www.foobar.org' and is the
owner of the domain 'foobar.org'. The textdomain for your
company's software 'barfoos' should hence be
'org.foobar.barfoos'.</p>
<p style="margin-left:9%; margin-top: 1em">If your software
is likely to be installed in different versions on the same
system, it is probably a good idea to append some version
information to your textdomain.</p>
<p style="margin-left:9%; margin-top: 1em">Other systems
are less strict with the naming scheme for textdomains but
the phenomena known as Perl is actually a plethora of small,
specialized modules and it is probably wisest to postulate
some namespace model in order to avoid chaos.</p>
<h3>Binding textdomains to directories
<a name="Binding textdomains to directories"></a>
</h3>
<p style="margin-left:9%; margin-top: 1em">Once the system
knows the <i>textdomain</i> of the message that you want to
get translated into the user's language, it still has to
find the correct message catalog. By default,
libintl−perl will look up the string in the
translation database found in the directories
<i>/usr/share/locale</i> and <i>/usr/local/share/locale</i>
(in that order).</p>
<p style="margin-left:9%; margin-top: 1em">It is neither
guaranteed that these directories exist on the target
machine, nor can you be sure that the installation routine
has write access to these locations. You can therefore
instruct libintl−perl to search other directories
prior to the default directories. Specifying a differnt
search directory is called <i>binding</i> a textdomain to a
directory.</p>
<p style="margin-left:9%; margin-top: 1em">Beginning with
version 1.20, <b>Locale::TextDomain</b> extends the default
strategy by a Perl−specific approach. If
File::ShareDir is installed, it will look in the
subdirectories named <i>locale</i> and <i>LocaleData</i> (in
that order) in the directory returned by
"File::ShareDir::dist_dir ($textdomain)" (if
File::ShareDir is installed), and check for a database
containing the message for your textdomain there. This
allows you to install your database in the
Perl−specific shared directory using Module::Install's
"install_share" directive or the Dist::Zilla
ShareDir plugin.</p>
<p style="margin-left:9%; margin-top: 1em">If
File::ShareDir is not availabe, or if Locale::TextDomain
fails to find the translation files in the File::ShareDir
directory, it will next look in every directory found in the
standard include path @INC, and check for a database
containing the message for your textdomain there. Example:
If the path <i>/usr/lib/perl/5.8.0/site_perl</i> is in your
@INC, you can install your translation files in
<i>/usr/lib/perl/5.8.0/site_perl/LocaleData</i>, and they
will be found at run−time.</p>
<h2>USAGE
<a name="USAGE"></a>
</h2>
<p style="margin-left:9%; margin-top: 1em">It is crucial to
remember that you use <b>Locale::TextDomain</b>(3) as
specified in the section "SYNOPSIS", that means
you have to <b>use</b> it, not <b>require</b> it. The module
behaves quite differently compared to other modules.</p>
<p style="margin-left:9%; margin-top: 1em">The most
significant difference is the meaning of the list passed as
an argument to the <b>use()</b> function. It actually works
like this:</p>
<p style="margin-left:9%; margin-top: 1em">use
Locale::TextDomain (TEXTDOMAIN, DIRECTORY, ...)</p>
<p style="margin-left:9%; margin-top: 1em">The first
argument (the first string passed to <b>use()</b>) is the
textdomain of your package, optionally followed by a list of
directories to search <i>instead</i> of the
Perl−specific directories (see above:
<i>/LocaleData</i> appended to a <i>File::ShareDir</i>
directory and every path in @INC).</p>
<p style="margin-left:9%; margin-top: 1em">If you are the
author of a package 'barfoos', you will probably put the
line</p>
<p style="margin-left:9%; margin-top: 1em">use
Locale::TextDomain 'barfoos';</p>
<p style="margin-left:9%; margin-top: 1em">resp. for
non−CPAN modules</p>
<p style="margin-left:9%; margin-top: 1em">use
Locale::TextDomain 'org.foobar.barfoos';</p>
<p style="margin-left:9%; margin-top: 1em">in every module
of your package that contains translatable strings. If your
module has been installed properly, including the message
catalogs, it will then be able to retrieve these
translations at run−time.</p>
<p style="margin-left:9%; margin-top: 1em">If you have not
installed the translation database in a directory
<i>LocaleData</i> in the File::ShareDir directory or the
standard include path @INC (or in the system directories
<i>/usr/share/locale</i> resp.
<i>/usr/local/share/locale</i>), you have to explicitely
specify a search path by giving the names of directories (as
strings!) as additional arguments to <b>use()</b>:</p>
<p style="margin-left:9%; margin-top: 1em">use
Locale::TextDomain qw (barfoos ./dir1 ./dir2);</p>
<p style="margin-left:9%; margin-top: 1em">Alternatively
you can call the function <b>bindtextdomain()</b> with
suitable arguments (see the entry for
<b>bindtextdomain()</b> in "FUNCTIONS" in
Locale::Messages). If you do so, you should pass
"undef" as an additional argument in order to
avoid unnecessary lookups:</p>
<p style="margin-left:9%; margin-top: 1em">use
Locale::TextDomain ('barfoos', undef);</p>
<p style="margin-left:9%; margin-top: 1em">You see that the
arguments given to <b>use()</b> have nothing to do with what
is imported into your namespace, but they are rather
arguments to <b>textdomain()</b>, resp.
<b>bindtextdomain()</b>. Does that mean that
<b>Locale::TextDomain</b> exports nothing into your
namespace? Umh, not exactly ... in fact it imports
<i>all</i> functions listed below into your namespace, and
hence you should not define conflicting functions (and
variables) yourself.</p>
<p style="margin-left:9%; margin-top: 1em">So, why has
Locale::TextDomain to be different from other modules? If
you have ever written software in C and prepared it for
internationalization (i18n), you will probably have defined
some preprocessor macros like:</p>
<p style="margin-left:9%; margin-top: 1em">#define
_(String) dgettext ("my−textdomain", String)
<br/>
#define N_(String) String</p>
<p style="margin-left:9%; margin-top: 1em">You only have to
define that once in C, and the textdomain for your package
is automatically inserted into all gettext functions. In
Perl there is no such mechanism (at least it is not
portable, option −P) and using the gettext functions
could become quite cumbersome without some extra
fiddling:</p>
<p style="margin-left:9%; margin-top: 1em">print dgettext
("my−textdomain", "Hello
world!\n");</p>
<p style="margin-left:9%; margin-top: 1em">This is no fun.
In C it would merely be a</p>
<p style="margin-left:9%; margin-top: 1em">printf
(_("Hello world!\n"));</p>
<p style="margin-left:9%; margin-top: 1em">Perl has to be
more concise and shorter than C ... see the next section for
how you can use <b>Locale::TextDomain</b> to end up in Perl
with a mere</p>
<p style="margin-left:9%; margin-top: 1em">print
__"Hello World!\n";</p>
<h2>EXPORTED FUNCTIONS
<a name="EXPORTED FUNCTIONS"></a>
</h2>
<p style="margin-left:9%; margin-top: 1em">All functions
have quite funny names on purpose. In fact the purpose for
that is quite clear: They should be short,
operator−like, and they should not yell for conflicts
with existing functions in <i>your</i> namespace. You will
understand it, when you internationalize your first Perl
program or module. Preparing it is more like marking strings
as being translatable than inserting function calls. Here we
go: <b><br/>
__ MSGID</b></p>
<p style="margin-left:14%;"><b>NOTE:</b> This is a
<i>double</i> underscore!</p>
<p style="margin-left:14%; margin-top: 1em">The basic and
most−used function. It is a short−cut for a call
to <b>gettext()</b> resp. <b>dgettext()</b>, and simply
returns the translation for <b>MSGID</b>. If your old code
reads like this:</p>
<p style="margin-left:14%; margin-top: 1em">print
"permission denied";</p>
<p style="margin-left:14%; margin-top: 1em">You will now
write:</p>
<p style="margin-left:14%; margin-top: 1em">print
__"permission denied";</p>
<p style="margin-left:14%; margin-top: 1em">That's all, the
string will be output in the user's preferred language,
provided that you have installed a translation for it.</p>
<p style="margin-left:14%; margin-top: 1em">Of course you
can also use parentheses:</p>
<p style="margin-left:14%; margin-top: 1em">print
__("permission denied");</p>
<p style="margin-left:14%; margin-top: 1em">Or even:</p>
<p style="margin-left:14%; margin-top: 1em">print
(__("permission denied"));</p>
<p style="margin-left:14%; margin-top: 1em">In my eyes, the
first version without parentheses looks best.</p>
<p style="margin-left:9%;"><b>__x MSGID, ID1 =&gt; VAL1,
ID2 =&gt; VAL2, ...</b></p>
<p style="margin-left:14%;">One of the nicest features in
Perl is its capability to interpolate variables into
strings:</p>
<p style="margin-left:14%; margin-top: 1em">print
"This is the $color $thing.\n";</p>
<p style="margin-left:14%; margin-top: 1em">This nice
feature might con you into thinking that you could now
write</p>
<p style="margin-left:14%; margin-top: 1em">print
__"This is the $color $thing.\n";</p>
<p style="margin-left:14%; margin-top: 1em">Alas, that
would be nice, but it is not possible. Remember that the
function __() serves both as an operator for translating
strings <i>and</i> as a mark for translatable strings. If
the above string would get extracted from your Perl code,
the un−interpolated form would end up in the message
catalog because when parsing your code it is unpredictable
what values the variables $thing and $color will have at
run−time (this fact is most probably one of the
reasons you have written your program for).</p>
<p style="margin-left:14%; margin-top: 1em">However, at
run−time, Perl will have interpolated the values
already <i>before</i> __() (resp. the underlying
<b>gettext()</b> function) has seen the original string.
Consequently something like "This is the red
car.\n" will be looked up in the message catalog, it
will not be found (because only "This is the $color
$thing.\n" is included in the database), and the
original, untranslated string will be returned. Honestly,
because this is almost always an error, the
<b>xgettext</b>(1) program will bail out with a fatal error
when it comes across that string in your code.</p>
<p style="margin-left:14%; margin-top: 1em">There are two
workarounds for that:</p>
<p style="margin-left:14%; margin-top: 1em">printf
__"This is the %s %s.\n", $color, $thing;</p>
<p style="margin-left:14%; margin-top: 1em">But that has
several disadvantages: Your translator will only see the
isolated string, and without the surrounding code it is
almost impossible to interpret it correctly. Of course, GNU
emacs and other software capable of editing PO translation
files will allow you to examine the context in the source
code, but it is more likely that your translator will look
for a less challenging translation project when she
frequently comes across such messages.</p>
<p style="margin-left:14%; margin-top: 1em">And even if she
does understand the underlying programming, what if she has
to reorder the color and the thing like in French:</p>
<p style="margin-left:14%; margin-top: 1em">msgid
"This is the red car.\n"; <br/>
msgstr "Cela est la voiture rouge.\n"</p>
<p style="margin-left:14%; margin-top: 1em">Zut alors!
While it is possible to reorder the arguments to
<b>printf()</b> and friends, it requires a syntax that is is
nothing that you want to learn.</p>
<p style="margin-left:14%; margin-top: 1em">So what? The
Perl backend to GNU gettext has defined an alternative
format for interpolatable strings:</p>
<p style="margin-left:14%; margin-top: 1em">"This is
the {color} {thing}.\n";</p>
<p style="margin-left:14%; margin-top: 1em">Instead of Perl
variables you use place−holders (legal Perl variables
are also legal place−holders) in curly braces, and
then you call</p>
<p style="margin-left:14%; margin-top: 1em">print __x
("This is the {color} {thing}.\n", <br/>
thing =&gt; $thang, <br/>
color =&gt; $color);</p>
<p style="margin-left:14%; margin-top: 1em">The function
_<b>_x()</b> will take the additional hash and replace all
occurencies of the hash keys in curly braces with the
corresponding values. Simple, readable, understandable to
translators, what else would you want? And if the translator
forgets, misspells or otherwise messes up some
"variables", the <b>msgfmt</b>(1) program, that is
used to compile the textual translation file into its binary
representation will even choke on these errors and refuse to
compile the translation.</p>
<p style="margin-left:9%;"><b>__n MSGID, MSGID_PLURAL,
COUNT</b></p>
<p style="margin-left:14%;">Whew! That looks complicated
... It is best explained with an example. We'll have another
look at your vintage code:</p>
<p style="margin-left:14%; margin-top: 1em">if
($files_deleted &gt; 1) { <br/>
print "All files have been deleted.\n"; <br/>
} else { <br/>
print "One file has been deleted.\n"; <br/>
}</p>
<p style="margin-left:14%; margin-top: 1em">Your intent is
clear, you wanted to avoid the cumbersome "1 files
deleted". This is okay for English, but other languages
have more than one plural form. For example in Russian it
makes a difference whether you want to say 1 file, 3 files
or 6 files. You will use three different forms of the noun
'file' in each case. [Note: Yep, very smart you are, the
Russian word for 'file' is in fact the English word, and it
is an invariable noun, but if you know that, you will also
understand the rest despite this little simplification
...].</p>
<p style="margin-left:14%; margin-top: 1em">That is the
reason for the existance of the function <b>ngettext()</b>,
that _<b>_n()</b> is a short−cut for:</p>
<p style="margin-left:14%; margin-top: 1em">print
__n"One file has been deleted.\n", <br/>
"All files have been deleted.\n", <br/>
$files_deleted;</p>
<p style="margin-left:14%; margin-top: 1em">Alternatively:</p>
<p style="margin-left:14%; margin-top: 1em">print __n
("One file has been deleted.\n", <br/>
"All files have been deleted.\n", <br/>
$files_deleted);</p>
<p style="margin-left:14%; margin-top: 1em">The effect is
always the same: libintl−perl will find out which
plural form to pick for your user's language, and the output
string will always look okay.</p>
<p style="margin-left:9%;"><b>__nx MSGID, MSGID_PLURAL,
COUNT, VAR1 =&gt; VAL1, VAR2 =&gt; VAL2, ...</b></p>
<p style="margin-left:14%;">Bringing it all together:</p>
<p style="margin-left:14%; margin-top: 1em">print __nx
("One file has been deleted.\n", <br/>
"{count} files have been deleted.\n", <br/>
$num_files, <br/>
count =&gt; $num_files);</p>
<p style="margin-left:14%; margin-top: 1em">The function
_<b>_nx()</b> picks the correct plural form (also for
English!) <i>and</i> it is capable of interpolating
variables into strings.</p>
<p style="margin-left:14%; margin-top: 1em">Have a close
look at the order of arguments: The first argument is the
string in the singular, the second one is the plural string.
The third one is an integer indicating the number of items.
This third argument is <i>only</i> used to pick the correct
translation. The optionally following arguments make up the
hash used for interpolation. In the beginning it is often a
little confusing that the variable holding the number of
items will usually be repeated somewhere in the
interpolation hash.</p>
<p style="margin-left:9%;"><b>__xn MSGID, MSGID_PLURAL,
COUNT, VAR1 =&gt; VAL1, VAR2 =&gt; VAL2, ...</b></p>
<p style="margin-left:14%;">Does exactly the same thing as
_<b>_nx()</b>. In fact it is a common typo promoted to a
feature.</p>
<p style="margin-left:9%;"><b>__p MSGCTXT, MSGID</b></p>
<p style="margin-left:14%;">This is much like __. The
"p" stands for "particular", and the
MSGCTXT is used to provide context to the translator. This
may be neccessary when your string is short, and could stand
for multiple things. For example:</p>
<p style="margin-left:14%; margin-top: 1em">print
__p"Verb, to view", "View"; <br/>
print __p"Noun, a view", "View";</p>
<p style="margin-left:14%; margin-top: 1em">The above may
be "View" entries in a menu, where
View−&gt;Source and File−&gt;View are different
forms of "View", and likely need to be translated
differently.</p>
<p style="margin-left:14%; margin-top: 1em">A typical usage
are GUI programs. Imagine a program with a main menu and the
notorious "Open" entry in the "File"
menu. Now imagine, there is another menu entry
Preferences−&gt;Advanced−&gt;Policy where you
have a choice between the alternatives "Open" and
"Closed". In English, "Open" is the
adequate text at both places. In other languages, it is very
likely that you need two different translations. Therefore,
you would now write:</p>
<p style="margin-left:14%; margin-top: 1em">__p"File|",
"Open"; <br/>
__p"Preferences|Advanced|Policy",
"Open";</p>
<p style="margin-left:14%; margin-top: 1em">In English, or
if no translation can be found, the second argument (MSGID)
is returned.</p>
<p style="margin-left:14%; margin-top: 1em">This function
was introduced in libintl−perl 1.17.</p>
<p style="margin-left:9%;"><b>__px MSGCTXT, MSGID, VAR1
=&gt; VAL1, VAR2 =&gt; VAL2, ...</b></p>
<p style="margin-left:14%;">Like _<b>_p()</b>, but supports
variable substitution in the string, like _<b>_x()</b>.</p>
<p style="margin-left:14%; margin-top: 1em">print
__px("Verb, to view", "View {file}",
file =&gt; $filename);</p>
<p style="margin-left:14%; margin-top: 1em">See
_<b>_p()</b> and _<b>_x()</b> for more details.</p>
<p style="margin-left:14%; margin-top: 1em">This function
was introduced in libintl−perl 1.17.</p>
<p style="margin-left:9%;"><b>__np MSGCTXT, MSGID,
MSGID_PLURAL, COUNT</b></p>
<p style="margin-left:14%;">This adds context to plural
calls. It should not be needed very often, if at all, due to
the _<b>_nx()</b> function. The type of variable
substitution used in other gettext libraries (using
sprintf−like sybols, like %s or %1) sometimes required
context. For a (bad) example of this:</p>
<p style="margin-left:14%; margin-top: 1em">printf
(__np("[count] files have been deleted", <br/>
"One file has been deleted.\n", <br/>
"%s files have been deleted.\n", <br/>
$num_files), <br/>
$num_files);</p>
<p style="margin-left:14%; margin-top: 1em">NOTE: The above
usage is discouraged. Just use the _<b>_nx()</b> call, which
provides inline context via the key names.</p>
<p style="margin-left:14%; margin-top: 1em">This function
was introduced in libintl−perl 1.17.</p>
<p style="margin-left:9%;"><b>__npx MSGCTXT, MSGID,
MSGID_PLURAL, COUNT, VAR1 =&gt; VAL1, VAR2 =&gt; VAL2, <br/>
...</b></p>
<p style="margin-left:14%;">This is provided for
comleteness. It adds the variable interpolation into the
string to the previous method, _<b>_np()</b>.</p>
<p style="margin-left:14%; margin-top: 1em">It's usage
would be like so:</p>
<p style="margin-left:14%; margin-top: 1em">print __npx
("Files being permenantly removed", <br/>
"One file has been deleted.\n", <br/>
"{count} files have been deleted.\n", <br/>
$num_files, <br/>
count =&gt; $num_files);</p>
<p style="margin-left:14%; margin-top: 1em">I cannot think
of any situations requiring this, but we can easily support
it, so here it is.</p>
<p style="margin-left:14%; margin-top: 1em">This function
was introduced in libintl−perl 1.17.</p>
<p style="margin-left:9%;"><b>N__(ARG1)</b></p>
<p style="margin-left:14%;">A no−op function that
simply echoes its arguments to the caller. Take the
following piece of Perl:</p>
<p style="margin-left:14%; margin-top: 1em">my @options = (
<br/>
"Open", <br/>
"Save", <br/>
"Save As", <br/>
); <br/>
... <br/>
my $option = $options[1];</p>
<p style="margin-left:14%; margin-top: 1em">Now say that
you want to have this translatable. You could sometimes
simply do:</p>
<p style="margin-left:14%; margin-top: 1em">my @options = (
<br/>
__"Open", <br/>
__"Save", <br/>
__"Save As", <br/>
); <br/>
... <br/>
my $option = $options[1];</p>
<p style="margin-left:14%; margin-top: 1em">But often times
this will not be what you want, for example when you also
need the unmodified original string. Sometimes it may not
even work, for example, when the preferred user language is
not yet determined at the time that the list is
initialized.</p>
<p style="margin-left:14%; margin-top: 1em">In these cases
you would write:</p>
<p style="margin-left:14%; margin-top: 1em">my @options = (
<br/>
N__"Open", <br/>
N__"Save", <br/>
N__"Save As", <br/>
); <br/>
... <br/>
my $option = __($options[1]); <br/>
# or: my $option = dgettext ('my−domain',
$options[1]);</p>
<p style="margin-left:14%; margin-top: 1em">Now all the
strings in @options will be left alone, since N__() returns
its arguments (one ore more) unmodified. Nevertheless, the
string extractor will be able to recognize the strings as
being translatable. And you can still get the translation
later by passing the variable instead of the string to one
of the above translation functions.</p>
<p style="margin-left:9%;"><b>N__n (MSGID, MSGID_PLURAL,
COUNT)</b></p>
<p style="margin-left:14%;">Does exactly the same as N__().
You will use this form if you have to mark the strings as
having plural forms.</p>
<p style="margin-left:9%;"><b>N__p (MSGCTXT, MSGID)</b></p>
<p style="margin-left:14%;">Marks <b>MSGID</b> as N__()
does, but in the context <b>MSGCTXT</b>.</p>
<p style="margin-left:9%;"><b>N__np (MSGCTXT, MSGID,
MSGID_PLURAL, COUNT)</b></p>
<p style="margin-left:14%;">Marks <b>MSGID</b> as
N_<b>_n()</b> does, but in the context <b>MSGCTXT</b>.</p>
<h2>EXPORTED VARIABLES

better for your translation team than</p>
<p style="margin-left:14%; margin-top: 1em">my $title =

<p style="margin-left:14%; margin-top: 1em">In the second
case the HTML code will make it into the translation

syntax when translating strings.</p>
<p style="margin-left:14%; margin-top: 1em"><b>Warning:</b>
Do <i>not</i> use this hash outside of double−quoted
strings! The code in the tied hash object relies on the
correct working of the function <b>caller()</b> (see
"perldoc −f caller"), and this function will
report incorrect results if the tied hash value is the
argument to a function from another package, for
example:</p>
<p style="margin-left:14%; margin-top: 1em">my $result =
Other::Package::do_it ($__{'Some string'});</p>
<p style="margin-left:14%; margin-top: 1em">The tied hash
code will see "Other::Package" as the calling
package, instead of your own package. Consequently it will
look up the message in the wrong text domain. There is no
workaround for this bug. Therefore:</p>
<p style="margin-left:14%; margin-top: 1em">Never use the
tied hash interpolated strings!</p>

<h2>CLASS METHODS
<a name="CLASS METHODS"></a>
</h2>
<p style="margin-left:9%; margin-top: 1em">The following
class methods are defined: <b><br/>
options</b></p>
<p style="margin-left:14%;">Returns a space−separated
list of all '−−keyword' and all
'−−flag' options for <b>xgettext(1)</b>, when
extracing strings from Perl source files localized with
<b>Locale::TextDomain</b>.</p>
<p style="margin-left:14%; margin-top: 1em">The option
should rather be called <b>xgettextDefaultOptions</b>. With
regard to the typical use−case, a shorter name has
been picked:</p>
<p style="margin-left:14%; margin-top: 1em">xgettext `perl
−MLocale::TextDomain −e 'print
Locale::TextDomain−&gt;options'`</p>
<p style="margin-left:14%; margin-top: 1em">See
&lt;https://www.gnu.org/software/gettext/manual/html_node/xgettext−Invocation.html&gt;
for more information about the xgettext options
'−−keyword' and '−−flag'.</p>
<p style="margin-left:14%; margin-top: 1em">If you want to
disable the use of the xgettext default keywords, you should
pass an option '−−keyword=""' to
xgettext before the options returned by this method.</p>
<p style="margin-left:14%; margin-top: 1em">If you doubt
the usefulness of this method, check the output on the
command−line:</p>
<p style="margin-left:14%; margin-top: 1em">perl
−MLocale::TextDomain −e 'print
Locale::TextDomain−&gt;options'</p>
<p style="margin-left:14%; margin-top: 1em">Nothing that
you want to type yourself.</p>
<p style="margin-left:14%; margin-top: 1em">This method was
added in libintl−perl 1.28.</p>
<p style="margin-left:9%;"><b>keywords</b></p>
<p style="margin-left:14%;">Returns a space−separated
list of all '−−keyword' options for
<b>xgettext(1)</b> so that all translatable strings are
properly extracted.</p>
<p style="margin-left:14%; margin-top: 1em">This method was
added in libintl−perl 1.28.</p>
<p style="margin-left:9%;"><b>flags</b></p>
<p style="margin-left:14%;">Returns a space−separated
list of all '−−flag' options for
<b>xgettext(1)</b> so that extracted strings are properly
flagged.</p>
<p style="margin-left:14%; margin-top: 1em">This method was
added in libintl−perl 1.28.</p>
<h2>PERFORMANCE
<a name="PERFORMANCE"></a>
</h2>
<p style="margin-left:9%; margin-top: 1em">Message
translation can be a time−consuming task. Take this
little example:</p>
<p style="margin-left:9%; margin-top: 1em">1: use
Locale::TextDomain ('my−domain'); <br/>
2: use POSIX (:locale_h); <br/>
3: <br/>
4: setlocale (LC_ALL, ''); <br/>
5: print __"Hello world!\n";</p>
<p style="margin-left:9%; margin-top: 1em">This will
usually be quite fast, but in pathological cases it may run
for several seconds. A worst−case scenario would be a
Chinese user at a terminal that understands the codeset
Big5−HKSCS. Your translator for Chinese has however
chosen to encode the translations in the codeset
EUC−TW.</p>
<p style="margin-left:9%; margin-top: 1em">What will happen
at run−time? First, the library will search and load a
(maybe large) message catalog for your textdomain
'my−domain'. Then it will look up the translation for
"Hello world!\n", it will find that it is encoded
in EUC−TW. Since that differs from the output codeset
Big5−HKSCS, it will first load a conversion table
containing several ten−thousands of codepoints for
EUC−TW, then it does the same with the smaller, but
still very large conversion table for Big5−HKSCS, it
will convert the translation on the fly from EUC−TW
into Big5−HKSCS, and finally it will return the
converted translation.</p>
<p style="margin-left:9%; margin-top: 1em">A
worst−case scenario but realistic. And for these five
lines of codes, there is not much you can do to make it any
faster. You should understand, however, <i>when</i> the
different steps will take place, so that you can arrange
your code for it.</p>
<p style="margin-left:9%; margin-top: 1em">You have learned
in the section "DESCRIPTION" that line 1 is
responsible for locating your message database. However, the
<b>use()</b> will do nothing more than remembering your
settings. It will not search any directories, it will not
load any catalogs or conversion tables.</p>
<p style="margin-left:9%; margin-top: 1em">Somewhere in
your code you will always have a call to
<b>POSIX::setlocale()</b>, and the performance of this call
may be time−consuming, depending on the architecture
of your system. On some systems, this will consume very
little time, on others it will only consume a considerable
amount of time for the first call, and on others it may
always be time−consuming. Since you cannot know, how
<b>setlocale()</b> is implemented on the target system, you
should reduce the calls to <b>setlocale()</b> to a
minimum.</p>
<p style="margin-left:9%; margin-top: 1em">Line 5 requests
the translation for your string. Only now, the library will
actually load the message catalog, and only now will it load
eventually needed conversion tables. And from now on, all
this information will be cached in memory. This strategy is
used throughout libintl−perl, and you may describe it
as 'load−on−first−access'. Getting the
next translation will consume very little resources.</p>
<p style="margin-left:9%; margin-top: 1em">However,
although the translation retrieval is somewhat obfuscated by
an operator−like function call, it is still a function
call, and in fact it even involves a chain of function
calls. Consequently, the following example is probably bad
practice:</p>
<p style="margin-left:9%; margin-top: 1em">foreach (1 ..
100_000) { <br/>
print __"Hello world!\n"; <br/>
}</p>
<p style="margin-left:9%; margin-top: 1em">This example
introduces a lot of overhead into your program. Better do
this:</p>
<p style="margin-left:9%; margin-top: 1em">my $string =
__"Hello world!\n"; <br/>
foreach (1 .. 100_000) { <br/>
print $string; <br/>
}</p>
<p style="margin-left:9%; margin-top: 1em">The translation
will never change, there is no need to retrieve it over and
over again. Although libintl−perl will of course cache
the translation read from the file system, you can still
avoid the overhead for the function calls.</p>
