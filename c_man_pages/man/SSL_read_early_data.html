<h2>DESCRIPTION
<a name="DESCRIPTION"></a>
</h2>
<p style="margin-left:9%; margin-top: 1em">These functions
are used to send and receive early data where TLSv1.3 has
been negotiated. Early data can be sent by the client
immediately after its initial ClientHello without having to
wait for the server to complete the handshake. Early data
can be sent if a session has previously been established
with the server or when establishing a new session using an
out−of−band PSK, and only when the server is
known to support it. Additionally these functions can be
used to send data from the server to the client when the
client has not yet completed the authentication stage of the
handshake.</p>
<p style="margin-left:9%; margin-top: 1em">Early data has
weaker security properties than other data sent over an
SSL/TLS connection. In particular the data does not have
forward secrecy. There are also additional considerations
around replay attacks (see "REPLAY PROTECTION"
below). For these reasons extreme care should be exercised
when using early data. For specific details, consult the TLS
1.3 specification.</p>
<p style="margin-left:9%; margin-top: 1em">When a server
receives early data it may opt to immediately respond by
sending application data back to the client. Data sent by
the server at this stage is done before the full handshake
has been completed. Specifically the client's authentication
messages have not yet been received, i.e. the client is
unauthenticated at this point and care should be taken when
using this capability.</p>
<p style="margin-left:9%; margin-top: 1em">A server or
client can determine whether the full handshake has been
completed or not by calling
<b>SSL_is_init_finished</b>(3).</p>
<p style="margin-left:9%; margin-top: 1em">On the client
side, the function <b>SSL_SESSION_get_max_early_data()</b>
can be used to determine if a session established with a
server can be used to send early data. If the session cannot
be used then this function will return 0. Otherwise it will
return the maximum number of early data bytes that can be
sent.</p>
<p style="margin-left:9%; margin-top: 1em">The function
<b>SSL_SESSION_set_max_early_data()</b> sets the maximum
number of early data bytes that can be sent for a session.
This would typically be used when creating a PSK session
file (see <b>SSL_CTX_set_psk_use_session_callback</b>(3)).
If using a ticket based PSK then this is set automatically
to the value provided by the server.</p>
<p style="margin-left:9%; margin-top: 1em">A client uses
the function <b>SSL_write_early_data()</b> to send early
data. This function is similar to the <b>SSL_write_ex</b>(3)
function, but with the following differences. See
<b>SSL_write_ex</b>(3) for information on how to write bytes
to the underlying connection, and how to handle any errors
that may arise. This page describes the differences between
<b>SSL_write_early_data()</b> and
<b>SSL_write_ex</b>(3).</p>
<p style="margin-left:9%; margin-top: 1em">When called by a
client, <b>SSL_write_early_data()</b> must be the first IO
function called on a new connection, i.e. it must occur
before any calls to <b>SSL_write_ex</b>(3),
<b>SSL_read_ex</b>(3), <b>SSL_connect</b>(3),
<b>SSL_do_handshake</b>(3) or other similar functions. It
may be called multiple times to stream data to the server,
but the total number of bytes written must not exceed the
value returned from <b>SSL_SESSION_get_max_early_data()</b>.
Once the initial <b>SSL_write_early_data()</b> call has
completed successfully the client may interleave calls to
<b>SSL_read_ex</b>(3) and <b>SSL_read</b>(3) with calls to
<b>SSL_write_early_data()</b> as required.</p>
<p style="margin-left:9%; margin-top: 1em">If
<b>SSL_write_early_data()</b> fails you should call
<b>SSL_get_error</b>(3) to determine the correct course of
action, as for <b>SSL_write_ex</b>(3).</p>
<p style="margin-left:9%; margin-top: 1em">When the client
no longer wishes to send any more early data then it should
complete the handshake by calling a function such as
<b>SSL_connect</b>(3) or <b>SSL_do_handshake</b>(3).
Alternatively you can call a standard write function such as
<b>SSL_write_ex</b>(3), which will transparently complete
the connection and write the requested data.</p>
<p style="margin-left:9%; margin-top: 1em">A server may
choose to ignore early data that has been sent to it. Once
the connection has been completed you can determine whether
the server accepted or rejected the early data by calling
<b>SSL_get_early_data_status()</b>. This will return
SSL_EARLY_DATA_ACCEPTED if the data was accepted,
SSL_EARLY_DATA_REJECTED if it was rejected or
SSL_EARLY_DATA_NOT_SENT if no early data was sent. This
function may be called by either the client or the
server.</p>
<p style="margin-left:9%; margin-top: 1em">A server uses
the <b>SSL_read_early_data()</b> function to receive early
data on a connection for which early data has been enabled
using <b>SSL_CTX_set_max_early_data()</b> or
<b>SSL_set_max_early_data()</b>. As for
<b>SSL_write_early_data()</b>, this must be the first IO
function called on a connection, i.e. it must occur before
any calls to <b>SSL_write_ex</b>(3), <b>SSL_read_ex</b>(3),
<b>SSL_accept</b>(3), <b>SSL_do_handshake</b>(3), or other
similar functions.</p>
<p style="margin-left:9%; margin-top: 1em"><b>SSL_read_early_data()</b>
is similar to <b>SSL_read_ex</b>(3) with the following
differences. Refer to <b>SSL_read_ex</b>(3) for full
details.</p>
<p style="margin-left:9%; margin-top: 1em"><b>SSL_read_early_data()</b>
may return 3 possible values: <br/>
SSL_READ_EARLY_DATA_ERROR</p>
<p style="margin-left:14%;">This indicates an IO or some
other error occurred. This should be treated in the same way
as a 0 return value from <b>SSL_read_ex</b>(3).</p>
<p style="margin-left:9%;">SSL_READ_EARLY_DATA_SUCCESS</p>
<p style="margin-left:14%;">This indicates that early data
was successfully read. This should be treated in the same
way as a 1 return value from <b>SSL_read_ex</b>(3). You
should continue to call <b>SSL_read_early_data()</b> to read
more data.</p>
<p style="margin-left:9%;">SSL_READ_EARLY_DATA_FINISH</p>
<p style="margin-left:14%;">This indicates that no more
early data can be read. It may be returned on the first call
to <b>SSL_read_early_data()</b> if the client has not sent
any early data, or if the early data was rejected.</p>
<p style="margin-left:9%; margin-top: 1em">Once the initial
<b>SSL_read_early_data()</b> call has completed successfully
(i.e. it has returned SSL_READ_EARLY_DATA_SUCCESS or
SSL_READ_EARLY_DATA_FINISH) then the server may choose to
write data immediately to the unauthenticated client using
<b>SSL_write_early_data()</b>. If
<b>SSL_read_early_data()</b> returned
SSL_READ_EARLY_DATA_FINISH then in some situations (e.g. if
the client only supports TLSv1.2) the handshake may have
already been completed and calls to
<b>SSL_write_early_data()</b> are not allowed. Call
<b>SSL_is_init_finished</b>(3) to determine whether the
handshake has completed or not. If the handshake is still in
progress then the server may interleave calls to
<b>SSL_write_early_data()</b> with calls to
<b>SSL_read_early_data()</b> as required.</p>
<p style="margin-left:9%; margin-top: 1em">Servers must not
call <b>SSL_read_ex</b>(3), <b>SSL_read</b>(3),
<b>SSL_write_ex</b>(3) or <b>SSL_write</b>(3) until
<b>SSL_read_early_data()</b> has returned with
SSL_READ_EARLY_DATA_FINISH. Once it has done so the
connection to the client still needs to be completed.
Complete the connection by calling a function such as
<b>SSL_accept</b>(3) or <b>SSL_do_handshake</b>(3).
Alternatively you can call a standard read function such as
<b>SSL_read_ex</b>(3), which will transparently complete the
connection and read the requested data. Note that it is an
error to attempt to complete the connection before
<b>SSL_read_early_data()</b> has returned
SSL_READ_EARLY_DATA_FINISH.</p>
<p style="margin-left:9%; margin-top: 1em">Only servers may
call <b>SSL_read_early_data()</b>.</p>
<p style="margin-left:9%; margin-top: 1em">Calls to
<b>SSL_read_early_data()</b> may, in certain circumstances,
complete the connection immediately without further need to
call a function such as <b>SSL_accept</b>(3). This can
happen if the client is using a protocol version less than
TLSv1.3. Applications can test for this by calling
<b>SSL_is_init_finished</b>(3). Alternatively, applications
may choose to call <b>SSL_accept</b>(3) anyway. Such a call
will successfully return immediately with no further action
taken.</p>
<p style="margin-left:9%; margin-top: 1em">When a session
is created between a server and a client the server will
specify the maximum amount of any early data that it will
accept on any future connection attempt. By default the
server does not accept early data; a server may indicate
support for early data by calling
<b>SSL_CTX_set_max_early_data()</b> or
<b>SSL_set_max_early_data()</b> to set it for the whole
SSL_CTX or an individual SSL object respectively. The
<b>max_early_data</b> parameter specifies the maximum amount
of early data in bytes that is permitted to be sent on a
single connection. Similarly the
<b>SSL_CTX_get_max_early_data()</b> and
<b>SSL_get_max_early_data()</b> functions can be used to
obtain the current maximum early data settings for the
SSL_CTX and SSL objects respectively. Generally a server
application will either use both of
<b>SSL_read_early_data()</b> and
<b>SSL_CTX_set_max_early_data()</b> (or
<b>SSL_set_max_early_data()</b>), or neither of them, since
there is no practical benefit from using only one of them.
If the maximum early data setting for a server is nonzero
then replay protection is automatically enabled (see
"REPLAY PROTECTION" below).</p>
<p style="margin-left:9%; margin-top: 1em">If the server
rejects the early data sent by a client then it will skip
over the data that is sent. The maximum amount of received
early data that is skipped is controlled by the
recv_max_early_data setting. If a client sends more than
this then the connection will abort. This value can be set
by calling <b>SSL_CTX_set_recv_max_early_data()</b> or
<b>SSL_set_recv_max_early_data()</b>. The current value for
this setting can be obtained by calling
<b>SSL_CTX_get_recv_max_early_data()</b> or
<b>SSL_get_recv_max_early_data()</b>. The default value for
this setting is 16,384 bytes.</p>
<p style="margin-left:9%; margin-top: 1em">The
recv_max_early_data value also has an impact on early data
that is accepted. The amount of data that is accepted will
always be the lower of the max_early_data for the session
and the recv_max_early_data setting for the server. If a
client sends more data than this then the connection will
abort.</p>
<p style="margin-left:9%; margin-top: 1em">The configured
value for max_early_data on a server may change over time as
required. However, clients may have tickets containing the
previously configured max_early_data value. The
recv_max_early_data should always be equal to or higher than
any recently configured max_early_data value in order to
avoid aborted connections. The recv_max_early_data should
never be set to less than the current configured
max_early_data value.</p>
<p style="margin-left:9%; margin-top: 1em">Some server
applications may wish to have more control over whether
early data is accepted or not, for example to mitigate
replay risks (see "REPLAY PROTECTION" below) or to
decline early_data when the server is heavily loaded. The
functions <b>SSL_CTX_set_allow_early_data_cb()</b> and
<b>SSL_set_allow_early_data_cb()</b> set a callback which is
called at a point in the handshake immediately before a
decision is made to accept or reject early data. The
callback is provided with a pointer to the user data
argument that was provided when the callback was first set.
Returning 1 from the callback will allow early data and
returning 0 will reject it. Note that the OpenSSL library
may reject early data for other reasons in which case this
callback will not get called. Notably, the built−in
replay protection feature will still be used even if a
callback is present unless it has been explicitly disabled
using the SSL_OP_NO_ANTI_REPLAY option. See "REPLAY
PROTECTION" below.</p>
<p style="margin-left:9%; margin-top: 1em">These functions
cannot currently be used with QUIC SSL objects.
<b>SSL_set_max_early_data()</b>,
<b>SSL_set_recv_max_early_data()</b>,
<b>SSL_write_early_data()</b>, <b>SSL_read_early_data()</b>,
<b>SSL_get_early_data_status()</b> and
<b>SSL_set_allow_early_data_cb()</b> fail if called on a
QUIC SSL object.</p>
<h2>NOTES
<a name="NOTES"></a>
</h2>
<p style="margin-left:9%; margin-top: 1em">The whole
purpose of early data is to enable a client to start sending
data to the server before a full round trip of network
traffic has occurred. Application developers should ensure
they consider optimisation of the underlying TCP socket to
obtain a performant solution. For example Nagle's algorithm
is commonly used by operating systems in an attempt to avoid
lots of small TCP packets. In many scenarios this is
beneficial for performance, but it does not work well with
the early data solution as implemented in OpenSSL. In
Nagle's algorithm the OS will buffer outgoing TCP data if a
TCP packet has already been sent which we have not yet
received an ACK for from the peer. The buffered data will
only be transmitted if enough data to fill an entire TCP
packet is accumulated, or if the ACK is received from the
peer. The initial ClientHello will be sent in the first TCP
packet along with any data from the first call to
<b>SSL_write_early_data()</b>. If the amount of data written
will exceed the size of a single TCP packet, or if there are
more calls to <b>SSL_write_early_data()</b> then that
additional data will be sent in subsequent TCP packets which
will be buffered by the OS and not sent until an ACK is
received for the first packet containing the ClientHello.
This means the early data is not actually sent until a
complete round trip with the server has occurred which
defeats the objective of early data.</p>
<p style="margin-left:9%; margin-top: 1em">In many
operating systems the TCP_NODELAY socket option is available
to disable Nagle's algorithm. If an application opts to
disable Nagle's algorithm consideration should be given to
turning it back on again after the handshake is complete if
appropriate.</p>
<p style="margin-left:9%; margin-top: 1em">In rare
circumstances, it may be possible for a client to have a
session that reports a max early data value greater than 0,
but where the server does not support this. For example,
this can occur if a server has had its configuration changed
to accept a lower max early data value such as by calling
<b>SSL_CTX_set_recv_max_early_data()</b>. Another example is
if a server used to support TLSv1.3 but was later downgraded
to TLSv1.2. Sending early data to such a server will cause
the connection to abort. Clients that encounter an aborted
connection while sending early data may want to retry the
connection without sending early data as this does not
happen automatically. A client will have to establish a new
transport layer connection to the server and attempt the
SSL/TLS connection again but without sending early data.
Note that it is inadvisable to retry with a lower maximum
protocol version.</p>
<h2>REPLAY PROTECTION
<a name="REPLAY PROTECTION"></a>
</h2>
<p style="margin-left:9%; margin-top: 1em">When early data
is in use the TLS protocol provides no security guarantees
that the same early data was not replayed across multiple
connections. As a mitigation for this issue OpenSSL
automatically enables replay protection if the server is
configured with a nonzero max early data value. With replay
protection enabled sessions are forced to be single use
only. If a client attempts to reuse a session ticket more
than once, then the second and subsequent attempts will fall
back to a full handshake (and any early data that was
submitted will be ignored). Note that single use tickets are
enforced even if a client does not send any early data.</p>
<p style="margin-left:9%; margin-top: 1em">The replay
protection mechanism relies on the internal OpenSSL server
session cache (see
<b>SSL_CTX_set_session_cache_mode</b>(3)). When replay
protection is being used the server will operate as if the
SSL_OP_NO_TICKET option had been selected (see
<b>SSL_CTX_set_options</b>(3)). Sessions will be added to
the cache whenever a session ticket is issued. When a client
attempts to resume the session, OpenSSL will check for its
presence in the internal cache. If it exists then the
resumption is allowed and the session is removed from the
cache. If it does not exist then the resumption is not
allowed and a full handshake will occur.</p>
<p style="margin-left:9%; margin-top: 1em">Note that some
applications may maintain an external cache of sessions (see
<b>SSL_CTX_sess_set_new_cb</b>(3) and similar functions). It
is the application's responsibility to ensure that any
sessions in the external cache are also populated in the
internal cache and that once removed from the internal cache
they are similarly removed from the external cache. Failing
to do this could result in an application becoming
vulnerable to replay attacks. Note that OpenSSL will lock
the internal cache while a session is removed but that lock
is not held when the remove session callback (see
<b>SSL_CTX_sess_set_remove_cb</b>(3)) is called. This could
result in a small amount of time where the session has been
removed from the internal cache but is still available in
the external cache. Applications should be designed with
this in mind in order to minimise the possibility of replay
attacks.</p>
<p style="margin-left:9%; margin-top: 1em">The OpenSSL
replay protection does not apply to external Pre Shared Keys
(PSKs) (e.g. see
<b>SSL_CTX_set_psk_find_session_callback</b>(3)). Therefore,
extreme caution should be applied when combining external
PSKs with early data.</p>
<p style="margin-left:9%; margin-top: 1em">Some
applications may mitigate the replay risks in other ways.
For those applications it is possible to turn off the
built−in replay protection feature using the
<b>SSL_OP_NO_ANTI_REPLAY</b> option. See
<b>SSL_CTX_set_options</b>(3) for details. Applications can
also set a callback to make decisions about accepting early
data or not. See <b>SSL_CTX_set_allow_early_data_cb()</b>
above for details.</p>
<h2>RETURN VALUES
<a name="RETURN VALUES"></a>
</h2>
<p style="margin-left:9%; margin-top: 1em"><b>SSL_write_early_data()</b>
returns 1 for success or 0 for failure. In the event of a
failure call <b>SSL_get_error</b>(3) to determine the
correct course of action.</p>
<p style="margin-left:9%; margin-top: 1em"><b>SSL_read_early_data()</b>
returns SSL_READ_EARLY_DATA_ERROR for failure,
SSL_READ_EARLY_DATA_SUCCESS for success with more data to
read and SSL_READ_EARLY_DATA_FINISH for success with no more
to data be read. In the event of a failure call
<b>SSL_get_error</b>(3) to determine the correct course of
action.</p>
<p style="margin-left:9%; margin-top: 1em"><b>SSL_get_max_early_data()</b>,
<b>SSL_CTX_get_max_early_data()</b> and
<b>SSL_SESSION_get_max_early_data()</b> return the maximum
number of early data bytes that may be sent.</p>
<p style="margin-left:9%; margin-top: 1em"><b>SSL_set_max_early_data()</b>,
<b>SSL_CTX_set_max_early_data()</b> and
<b>SSL_SESSION_set_max_early_data()</b> return 1 for success
or 0 for failure.</p>
<p style="margin-left:9%; margin-top: 1em"><b>SSL_get_early_data_status()</b>
returns SSL_EARLY_DATA_ACCEPTED if early data was accepted
by the server, SSL_EARLY_DATA_REJECTED if early data was
rejected by the server, or SSL_EARLY_DATA_NOT_SENT if no
early data was sent.</p>
